d2vzqn*Pass this along*Today has not been a good day for this great community...
d2vzqn*Pass this along*Vape real juice. Vaporize real weed. You’ll be safe. Say no to cheap THC carts.
d2vzqn*Pass this along*I hate how all these news sources are putting box mods and stuff like that as the pictures for all these vapeing deaths and most of the time they don’t even talk about the dank vapes and all those other thc carts that are what are really killing people
d2vzqn*Pass this along*I can not believe that there is going to be a proposition to ban flavored e juice when it’s literally fake news. I can not believe it.
d2vzqn*Pass this along*Let burn a giant pile of tobacco in front of the White House.
d2vzqn*Pass this along*https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/stop-donald-trump-signing-federal-flavor-ban-e-cig-products
d2vzqn*Pass this along*My therapist told me that SMOKING IS HEALTHIER than vaping and to go pick up a pack of smokes at the nearest gas station. I think shes wrong
d2vzqn*Pass this along*I don't even understand what they are thinking. As soon as you ban something you then have to rely on DIY. At which point fucking flavored Ejuice will become just as black market and as shitty as the THC cartridges.
d2vzqn*Pass this along*i smoked 1 cigarette for the first time yesterday in almost 2 years due to just the happenings of the day and it just turned into a situation where even with the vape i just said fuck it and had a stick. i tell you what though. even though it was a 1 off meaning i'm not going to smoke another cigarette again if this shit that happened today happens then i wont hesitate for a second to grab a pack of smokes and get back into the habit which is horrible and sucks but i guess it sounds like the orange one has his eyes set on our community. maybe hannity needs to come on at 9pm tonight and say some shit like no president this is bad idea. i vape too lol
d2vzqn*Pass this along*"I don't mean to shitpost, but front page of CNN.com

    After vaping-related illness, teen now has lungs like 'a 70-year-old's'

Yup. Big sad picture. Seven additional stories under that. Its over. 
DIY, switch to tobacco flavors, unflavored, gum, lodgens.... whatever you need. Use the time now to prep in any way you can.. All those cottonwood flavors are going to be GONE by the end of the year. Little memes won't do anything. I know its pessimistic but we don't have enough money or any moral standing to joe public."
d2vzqn*Pass this along*Oh the true won't matter and they know it, now that they Trump to joined in the witch hunt, there's no stopping it, big tobacco won.
d2vzqn*Pass this along*Yaaaaas. Preach it!!!
d2vzqn*Pass this along*exactly. Illegal, pesticide-ridden, thc cartridges are doing the damage (and lets be real, its not nearly as much as cigarettes) and legit vape juices, pods, etc are getting the blame its retarded
d2vzqn*Pass this along*"This is a two fold issue. 


1. They can ban flavored e cigs to help big tobacco recover from customer losses. They'll get some soccer mom/boomer votes in the process too. 



2. They don't have to address the dangers of an unregulated marijuana market created by a failed prohibition."
d2vzqn*Pass this along*They're always saying that they are against vaping because of the kids. Well, what are they doing about that other kid flavored addictive stimulant that all kids of all ages have access to, caffeine?
dc7k2d*For real tho*“Weed people”
dc7k2d*For real tho*"Need to put the word 'counterfeit' in front of those THC Carts.

Plenty of good, legal carts in medical dispensaries which require State approved testing here in Michigan.

Edit: misspelled counterfeit like a chump."
dc7k2d*For real tho*The situation here in NYC is dire. I stocked up for a bit, however if need be I can at least shoot over to NJ for my vape needs.
dc7k2d*For real tho*But thankfully the safe spaces to shoot up heroin where you can get new needles, narcan in case you OD and a free test of your heroin to see if there is fentanyl or carfentanyl, will be vape free. Its a fucking joke.
dc7k2d*For real tho*Gotta get those tobacco company tax cuts.  How else are politicians going to pay for their second mansions?
dc7k2d*For real tho*This is probably exactly how it all happened
dc7k2d*For real tho*Wait till they ban it and all you can get is bootleg shit from China.
dc7k2d*For real tho*Wouldnt even an issue this bad if they'd just legalize weed and THC products countrywide. Government can get money off it via taxes and shit and yet still no! Its the governments fault the way i see it.
dc7k2d*For real tho*"As a ""weed person"" (lmao try stoner next time XD) who has ripped illegal, and legal carts. ( only been using legal for like a year) it is 100% some shit dealers are cutting their carts with."
dc7k2d*For real tho*Government doesn’t want to solve the problem
dc7k2d*For real tho*Local park in my town, in Canada, just banned smoking and vaping on all PUBLIC trails.  I understand bear where the kids play but 500 feet away on the other side of a river is a joke.  So I'll vape away as I walk
dc7k2d*For real tho*"It's actually not JUST people in anit-tobacco, it's pro-tobacco and ""Big Tobacco"" as well. They don't want people quitting."
dc7k2d*For real tho*It's infuriating how accurate this is -.-
dc7k2d*For real tho*Yeah that’s 100% accurate. I can’t even watch the news anymore it is such hardcore intellectually dishonest anti vaping propaganda.
dc7k2d*For real tho*"Its almost like tabacco companies are paying and in turn trying to hurt/push their only competitor out or something...

But that would never happen."
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*Even if they're heavy smokers, the vape still gets them every single time.
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*"My friend who *does* vape gets a cough attack from mine."
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*My girlfriend. Every. Single. Time. This is pretty much my face LoL
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*I insta puked 2 times the first day i bought my vape. Now my throat and vape are good friends.
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*But this friend also tends to both pre and post cook the juice. I only let people hit it if my coil is about ready to get swapped.
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*It is weird I can't tell if that's Willem Dafoe or Denis Leary?
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*🤣 each time I let my friend taste my juice he always bitches that I have high nic... sorry but 6mg is low enough.
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*"1. They make fun of you for vaping 
2. They try yours and cough
3. They start vaping"
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*Definitely me when I started vaping again but now I just have a consistent cough but I’m not sure if you can develop a smokers cough from vaping
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*"I had a buddy who also used to smoke, and he introduced me to pod systems. He ended up going back to smoking, while I got into sub-ohm setups, which he'd never tried.

So we were at a party and asked to try my new vape so I said sure and handed it to him. A lightbulb flashed in my head and I tried to warn him, but he couldn't hear me over the music and it was kinda too late anyway. Oops. 

Here's to learning the hard way."
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*"I really don't understand why this happens. For reference: 1) i smoked for 15 years before immediately switching to vaping. 2) for my entire ""smoking career"" I've also smoked cannabis faithfully multiple times a day.

Never coughed when trying a vape, yet EVERYONE I know, including those with very similar histories as me, do.

Anyone know why?"
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*Me: vapes without nic so the dude just exhales and says its useless
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*"""It's fine, I can handle it""

No, you can't.

*cue cough attack*"
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*Oh, right, why is that?
bm7zup*They asked to use it 🤷‍♂️*All good questions. I’d say it’s more dry. No allergies to my knowledge. I’ve only been vaping again since March but I use a nord with 35mg nic salts not sure if that makes any difference. I haven’t seen anyone for it yet. I would say it’s mainly triggered when i vape or after I’m done and I haven’t cut back since it’s so hard to put it down
d66sxm*😤*I wonder about the first guy to get arrested for intent to sell. Maybe I’m just uneducated on the matter but this seems like something that could easily climb the ranks in court. I would defend myself if that happens to me
d66sxm*😤*No shitting, now cops can use just about anything as probable cause to search you.
d66sxm*😤*[deleted]
d66sxm*😤*"Op you may never see this message, but i want you to know that you may have single handedly saved a life. Im going through waaaay to much for one person to carry. Havent ate, slept or laughed in 3 days.. Until i saw this. Thank you. 

-Overburdened stranger"
d66sxm*😤*o god o fuk
d66sxm*😤*ROFL
d66sxm*😤*but, sir, i work at the cheesecake factory
d66sxm*😤*Honestly officer its not real heisenberg.
d66sxm*😤*Lmao.  I was thinking the same thing today 😁
d66sxm*😤*Could’ve edited him blowing O’s lmao
d66sxm*😤*"They're always saying that they are against vaping because they don't want the kids to have access to an addictive stimulant, nicotine. 

Well, what are they doing about that other kid flavored addictive stimulant, found in hundreds of products, that all kids of all ages have easy access to, caffeine?

Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Mountain Dew, Redbull, Monster, Bang, or Reign to name just a few."
d66sxm*😤*And the DIYers like me get raided by the FBI in the middle of the night for operating a vape juice lab. Hopefully they're quiet because I don't want them to wake the wife and kids
d66sxm*😤*Safer if your car smells like weed pretty soon hah
d66sxm*😤*Yep leave it up to the government to solve a problem with creating more of the root cause, now there's definitely going to be even more black market juices, has nobody learned that prohibition doesn't work yet it's been constantly proven.
d66sxm*😤*Hilarious
76jp23*How I imagine some of you guys*I'm guessing this guy works at a vape shop and it's for an Instagram post advertising a sale or something
76jp23*How I imagine some of you guys*I would not want to put my device in the sand.. Seems like a bad time. 
76jp23*How I imagine some of you guys*It looks like he is praying to it.

I hate sand, it's rough, it's coarse and it gets everywhere.  

EDIT: coarse*"
76jp23*How I imagine some of you guys*I've taken one picture of my vape at my friends request to show him how big it was. Otherwise, I have never taken a picture of my vape and do not intend to.
76jp23*How I imagine some of you guys*Beach check. Living the dream.
76jp23*How I imagine some of you guys*Might work at or own a vape shop and needs some snazzy product pictures
76jp23*How I imagine some of you guys*Lol my friend runs the IG for his cbd company and always has the weirdest angle shots, so now this is all im gonna think about.

76jp23*How I imagine some of you guys*Darth Vaper would not approve.

daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*How much do you wanna bet the media doesn’t cover this story ? Media is scum
daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*still irresponsible. ILLICIT and CONTAMINATED THC carts are the culprit. NOT legal safe THC carts from legal dispensaries
daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*"Bit fucking late CDC you opened the door for your government to do some really horrendous shit. 
Congratulations if the ban goes country wide you will be the health organisation with the most blood on your hands in the world!"
daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*Is anyone else seeing all of the adds on Facebook and youtube that is criminalizing JUUL and spinning it that they are this horrible company that is targeting kids who must be stopped?  This really boils my blood especially seeing all of the comments agreeing with it on the posts.
daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*[deleted]
daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*And yet still a lie. Cannabis also isn't the cause.
daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*"I posted this elsewhere but it does put things in proportion, have not kept up with the deaths associated with the tainted vaping products but I think it’s 11. That’s over the course of this incident, in comparison 1315 people die a DAY from tobacco related illnesses.

I don’t pretend that vaping is completely harmless, genuine products don’t kill you with a couple of uses but long term we won’t know until people have been doing it for 30-40 years. 
Cannabis is likely not completely harmless either, you can’t believe it addresses many ailments but has no downside, that’s not how things work in life. I do believe that lab tested cannabis products are the safest cannabis products that have ever been available. Don’t buy shady products for any use, the world has too many people who do not give a shit if you wreak your lungs in this case or your plane crashes due to some fake engine part as long as they get their money."
daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*"I'm European, and I had a great opinion of CDC before they start shooting at vape. But these assholes are just as bad as any other, they are criminals, ready to intentionally kill thousands and thousands of people each year to get money from big tobacco. 

There is a bad smell coming from US right now, and it's not the custard flavors."
daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*"Finally they start reporting the truth. Did anybody else see this exchange where Rashida Tlaib accused this woman of being a conspiracy theorist and still a smoker, after vaping has saved her life? Tlaib is a disgrace to the Country for spewing this crap.

Same goes for the Governor of Michigan."

daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*Thank the vape lords that an official source is coming forward finally to dispel the misinformation and knee jerk witch hunting legislation
daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*The media is going to cover what they want to cover that’s how it

daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*This thread has been locked. It has devolved into nothing but a massive slew of people slamming one another, arguing, and shutting on specific individuals. This is officially adding nothing of positive value to this subreddit and it’s done.
daxuqb*OH WHAT'S THIS!? (Link in comments)*That’s good to hear
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*Very well said. I love that smoking is banned on hospital premises in the UK but vaping isn't. The NHS encourage vaping over smoking and haven't given into all of this fear mongering all over the US. The government's and NHS's stance on vaping hasn't changed at all. I think everyone should just move over here
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*"Am a brit and feel so bad for you Americans, its fear mongering so that big tobacco doesn't lose its cash.

In the UK, vape products are tightly regulated, my doctors suggested vaping before I started, and vape shops are popping up everywhere, everyone I've been to has the same goal, it's to help people, it's to encourage quitting, the vape shop I visit often helps ex smokers by drawing a plan to lower nicotine, and suggests the most affordable kits, juices, to keep costs low and people healthy.


I really hope America takes some notes from our system,"
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*Very well said !
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*"I agree 110% 


Just a fyi, i have confirmed with my LVS and the owner of a smoke shop in the Seneca Nation dont give two fucks what NYS says and will be selling flavored juice. 

Also NYS wont fuvk with them because they really really dont want the thruway to PA cut off or the Indians to install toll booths. 

They have a history of doing it and fighting the state police (physically) if need be. 

God bless them.

Edit: spelling and the fact i posted a similar post but not with confirmed by owner of the Seneca Smoke Shop."
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*Dead on. Maybe a few harmful effects we don't yet know of, but definitely less harmful than cigarettes... That is the issue here.
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*Damn right 👊🏻
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*THANKS FOR PLATINUM! THATS AMAZING!
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*I’ve been harmed by vaping, I burnt my finger rebuilding a coil and accidentally firing whilst positioning.
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*[deleted]
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*No adverse effects? Let's be real its lightyears better than smoking but to say there arent any adverse effects is a stretch. It's just like what 94% carcoginic than cigarettes? That 6% though.
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*"My wife got a vaper a decade ago - she went from a pack-a-day smoker immediately to only vaping. She still vapes a little - unflavoured weak nicotine, more of a habit than a strong addiction, but both of us agree it's not important enough to worry about breaking that habit. (She usually takes a puff or two per day, no more than a half dozen)

Vaping has saved her from future lung cancer. I wish she'd found it sooner. She tried to quit several times with no success.

I'm all for trying to prevent teens who have never smoked from vaping, but I wish all smokers would try vaping to try and stop smoking. Making vaping illegal is a scary thing. I wonder how many will go back to tobacco and risk lung cancer? And all the other smelly parts of being a smoker."
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*Louder for ones in the back!
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*Posts like this is why I joined this sub.
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*MAN, I would 100% agree with his post if he hadn't claimed that there are no possible adverse effects. It's really just too early to know the long term effects of vaping, but we can definitely be certain it's way better than smoking.
dllpum*Manager of a vape shop just posted this.*Thank you for sharing brother. The world is slowely hearing the truth about vaping. Well done.
epcgve*Found some bottles with a hidden message while working.*Finally something both sides can agree on.
epcgve*Found some bottles with a hidden message while working.*Holy shit... you should share this on pics or some other related sub. This is too good to only be shared in a relatively small vaping sub

Terrible how a few bad cops make all of them look bad. I’ve actually been lucky enough to meet a few solid ones. I once got radar’d at 140mph in a 65. Cop gave me a ticket for going over by 10mph. Told me “and u better not take this shit to court. I could’ve towed your car and had it destroyed due to all the non carb engine modifications’’

d9az1d*#MSABloodMoney*Yes. I want to live for my kids. Losing family is awful.
d9az1d*#MSABloodMoney*"I smoked for 35 years.... started vaping....6 years 3 months free from cigarettes.

Vaping saved me"
d9az1d*#MSABloodMoney*I agree with this.... as a prev smoker this ban is going to hurt a lot of people. They only care about one thing.... $$$$$ that's it. Vaping saves lives.... cigs destroy lives.
d9az1d*#MSABloodMoney*They don't think they're saving anybody, they are losing cigarette smokers and as a result profits are down so they feel the need to try to get people smoking again.
d9az1d*#MSABloodMoney*"After over 20 years smoking, vaping came to the rescue. I actually quit smoking by literally forgetting about the pack, with cigarettes still left in it (sorry big tobacco!) which makes sense from a psychological standpoint; To effectively quit a strong habit you need to replace it with something that is equally or more satisfying, such as vaping. Thus, downgrading to a gum that makes you want to puke won't be a magic bullet for many. Haven't touched a cigarette since I quit. Can't stand the stench of cigarette smoke now, don't know how I ever did... 

Flavor of the day right now is my own raspberry juice, but also enjoy other fruit flavors, lemonades and such. I also walked 20km (\~13mi) this summer in one go, something that I would never have been able to do while smoking. So thank you vaping for saving my life, my health and my money!

It is disturbing to see (possibly) well-meaning but obviously uneducated politicians and lobbyists basically promote tobacco while completely killing the one thing that has helped me and millions more. Seriously, once you're aware of the Dunning-Kruger effect the entire political system appears in a completely different light. Let's face it: We are ruled by idiots...

TL;DR; I'm a **grown-up** who **quit smoking** after **20 years** with the help of **fruit-flavored vape juice**, who can **no longer stand cigarette** smoke, and who can now **run and walk** again **without collapsing**."
d9az1d*#MSABloodMoney*Pretty much !!! It goes both ways really but thy only looking at one side and the normal population is brain dead so it don’t even mater anymore . The news can say anything and most of America will 💯% believe 💩
d9az1d*#MSABloodMoney*"Lost my dad to lung cancer. Mom has copd. Trying to get her to switch but the anti vape media has her scared to switch and the rest of my family encouraging her not too.     

Love this pic.     

I'm also a former smoker of 20 years, off them for almost 2, and my last physical my lungs are looking good, major improvement from 2 years ago. No more waking up with chest pains and getting winded from a simple jog around the block."
d9az1d*#MSABloodMoney*"Honestly I don't know what the idiots in control have in mind. But 0 MG nicotine would IMO be the easiest solution. Since E juice is NOT addictive but nicotine IS addictive. 

In my mind. Having my house juice custom made with nicotine added, is a nice convenience. But Adding nicotine to my own juice is a very minor inconvenience. Because you take your 0 Nic juice bottle, pop the top off with pliers/thumb nail, withdraw the appropriate amount of nicotine from a vial/bottle, inject the nicotine into the E juice, Pop the top back on, shake the bottle vigorously for a couple of minutes and voila.....

Banning flavored E juice or interfering with free market enterprise and responsible adults is stupid, reactionary in the extreme and mindless. It's like burning down your house because you found a few ants."
d9az1d*#MSABloodMoney*Wow.. this is stupid powerful.. right in the feels
d9az1d*#MSABloodMoney*Shit man. This made me really sad. I hope they get their hands out of big tobacco's pockets and their heads out of their asses.
d9az1d*#MSABloodMoney*"I smoked quite a lot. I have permanent lung damage from falling 65 feet to my face on concrete when I was 15. I collapsed both lungs, shattered my face and left arm. Broke both knees and have severe back damage as a result. 

Every day was a struggle to breath past the smoking and lung damage I've suffered. Since switching to vaping, I have gotten much better with my breathing and feel much better.

I'm thankful for the time I've had with vaping but it's getting harder to get the things I need to keep vaping. My local shops are losing inventory and customers due to the news spreading big tobacco agendas...

It's been fun, but as I can't afford another mod (my smok mag is dying on me) I'll have to go back to the cancer sticks. Hopefully one day, when all this is over, I can get back to vaping."

dag5pg*Preach*17 people already died this year in the US from lightning strikes. Your more likely to get stuck by lightning.
dag5pg*Preach*Just throw a surgeon general warning on those juices and call it good. Let people do what they want
dag5pg*Preach*[deleted]
dag5pg*Preach*They say that the most recent death wasn't to do with THC cartridges but additives to the flavourings the vaper used. They must have been unregulated.
dag5pg*Preach*"I have vaped for years and although I love my personal liberties they sure as fuck don’t compare to my constitutional rights.
Now the vape community finally sees the fear mongering and false info spread. 
Welcome to the world of being a firearm owner or even  free speech. Yes in both communities we are doing nothing wrong but are vilified by people who don’t participate. 
As a gun owner and a vaper I am part of multiple groups to protect my rights. All you can do is try and make your voice heard."
dag5pg*Preach*"“BUT THE CHILDREN... THINK OF THE CHILDREN!”

😶"
dag5pg*Preach*"All but one of the deaths are from fake THC cartridges cut with vitamin E acetate which basically turns into fat particles in your lungs.

The only reason people are dying is because it's illegal and not being regulated.

what do they think is going to happen when they make flavored vape juice illegal to sell?

Only one death has been from something that somebody added to their vape juice. He had really old vape equipment from 2012 and the stuff he added to the vape juice ate away at the plastic."
dag5pg*Preach*"I'm starting to think these kids are killing themselves on purpose just to have vaping ""outlawed"". Downvote away, I'm just being brutally honest. I mean, Tide Pods aren't illegal and some idiots still insisted on swallowing them just to end up hospitalized. (What were they fucking expecting to happen?) All for some form of media martyrdom, I guess. People love being memorialized for random shit. Always have. Always will. Humanity has always had a knack for giving their mortal lives just for some form of attention.

I grew up with chronic asthma. Literally almost didn't make it past my first few years of life because of it. Yet here I am, a grown man. Been vaping for somewhere between 5 - 7 years and still kicking. No oxygen tank, no unnecessary amounts of albuterol sulfate. Just plain ol' 3MG of nicotine and 100ML of vape juice every couple of weeks. Whatever. If someone were to croak from vaping it'd be me; just saying. Maybe I'm a living, breathing example as to how vaping isn't fatal, maybe I'm not. All I can say is that I'm a realist and facts are facts. I'm just here to call BS on the whole ordeal."
dag5pg*Preach*They should ban alcohol to it kills people to and ban the cops from carrying guns because they kill people this whole Vape issue is about MONEY
dag5pg*Preach*The reason why the news stories are not telling the actual product that is causing the deaths is because they have been telling so many lies and can't admit it so they will just keep people reading the bullshit by avoiding the truth.

d1s4ik*Local eCig Shop Manager's response to the media's fear tactics.*If I could upvote this 100 times, I would. People keep asking me if I’ve heard about the news of vaping killing people, and I keep trying to explain that it’s from black market cannabis oil vape cartridges. One arrogant individual even told me to stop talking and get a chest X-ray. Misinformation is so frustrating.

d1s4ik*Local eCig Shop Manager's response to the media's fear tactics.*"Mom literally begged me and my brother the other day to stop vaping and how its killing kids. Went on about how its killing people faster than cigarettes. I just stopped arguing because its lile talking to a brick wall, I only vape once in a blue moon anyway.

Edit: Both of my parents are smokers."
d1s4ik*Local eCig Shop Manager's response to the media's fear tactics.*"Yeah the media clings to vaping like flies to shit. And most of the things bad said aren’t even bad at all, just biased with no research whatsoever or completely unrelated. 
Media: “VAPING LEAVES KID IN CRITICAL CONDITION AT HOSPITAL”

d1s4ik*Local eCig Shop Manager's response to the media's fear tactics.*"The media are humping these stories like un-neutured pit bulls because they know the fear factor will get clicks.  Meanwhile I was vape shamed by a *smoker* yesterday.  The hypocrisy is galling."

In Germany every 24h over 300 people die because of tobacco but money always wins."
d1s4ik*Local eCig Shop Manager's response to the media's fear tactics.*I'm just gonna sit at home and cry now cuz here in Michigan they already banned flavored vape liquid :(
d1s4ik*Local eCig Shop Manager's response to the media's fear tactics.*"100% agreed - the US is the most corrupt and the tobacco companies want to eliminate competition (or buy it out like they have started to with Juul). The media represents the big tobacco interests and not those of the general public.

There is clearly an agenda afoot because the propaganda is hot and heavy now. It is being pounded every day."

d1s4ik*Local eCig Shop Manager's response to the media's fear tactics.*"I wish there was a really effective way to get this message out to the masses ! I'm so sick of the media twisting the vape industry into some horrible monster. Like every article I read about the ""dangers of vaping"" spend 95% of the article talking about all this bad shit that some half assed experiment found in vape juice and how it's fucking up people's lungs and shit.

Then the last 5% of the article casually mentions that the main cause of these illnesses are the product of blackmarket THC and CBD carts, and that most of the cases are from people who are either currently underaged or were underaged when they started ! 

And all these "" experts "" who say that vapes contain formaldehyde and heavy metals and shit. Like .... BITCH you know how many horrible chemicals are in cigarettes! Don't try to down play it and stuff vaping into the same boat !

I find it funny that it's only been VERY recent that these illnesses have been poping up but the average joe vaper, who has been vaping the same 12 monkeys flavor for the last 4 years can get a chest x-ray and you would see actual improvement in lung condition !!!"
9gf22r*Just my two cents*Ok but are they gonna ban bubble gum flavored vodka? Nah. That's ridiculous. Ejuice is already regulated you have to be a certain age to buy it. If there are stores selling to minors those stores should be held accountable. 
9gf22r*Just my two cents*"In the United States, the Senate has a bill proposed (S.3319) that if passed, will only allow ejuice makers to do tobacco flavored products.  Also, the FDA is thinking taking action along these lines.  (See included link from Paulmunkotv).

&#x200B;

Totally agree with the graphic.  Demanding that various flavors not be allowed because a minor ""might somehow get it"" to vape... that's like telling handgun or assault rifle ammunition manufactures that they can only make shells with rubber bullets."
9gf22r*Just my two cents*"When people start talking about ""protecting the children"", exercise caution. Someone is about to take your rights away."
9gf22r*Just my two cents*[deleted]
9gf22r*Just my two cents*There's a shop I went to one time where they ID everyone who comes in so if you don't have it or are underaged they kick you out right away
9gf22r*Just my two cents*"Does anyone else feel like this is gonna backfire significantly though? 

There's apparently an epidemic of teenagers now using nicotine in significant doses, and your gonna cut off their supply to it. They will then try to find a new way to get nicotine. Congrats you just boostes big tobacco's bottom line exponentially"
9gf22r*Just my two cents*Is this just in America?
9gf22r*Just my two cents*Big tobacco will spend whatever money to kill off e cigs.
9gf22r*Just my two cents*[deleted]
9gf22r*Just my two cents*Watch teen and adult smoking spike after this bill and then they will claim they don't know why people started smoking again
9gf22r*Just my two cents*I'm getting less and less surprised all the time. Canada has had flavoured tobacco products banned for a while (including menthol). As an adult you are not allowed to make your own decisions anymore. Don't worry though, you aren't allowed to have menthol cigarettes or flavoured cigarillos, but you can go smoke a joint!
9gf22r*Just my two cents*Like there is alcoholic snapple but vaping is more appealing 
9gf22r*Just my two cents*I honestly don't believe it's the problem of the shops  or the vape manufactures i think it's a problem of the people who are supplying it to teens, it's those fuck tards who not only give the shops a bad rap it's now fucking all of us over
9gf22r*Just my two cents*Using kids is an excuse. How much money is the drug industry losing on drugs that claim to help you stop smoking?  How cheap is vaping?  There’s your answer. 
9gf22r*Just my two cents*"Wouldn't it still be possible to just make out own juice?

It’s fucking sad and terrifying. Probably driven by big pharma.

I’m switching back to huffing gasoline while smoking analog cigs."

d925vc*Its been fun guys but I think its time to make the switch.*Personally, I am going to switch to THC oils, that are cut with Vitamin E.  because they aren't saying anything about that, so it must be safe.

I threw in that the stuff that's killing kids blah blah blah is off the street. Convo... I mentioned pg and vg. He said VG? That's vegetable glycerin which is an oil. We also discussed my ragged sleeping habits. I'm gonna have to switch to meth and alcohol. Meth to wake me up in daytime and alcohol to knock me out at night. Hope he approves this method at my 6 month appointment.

a2x4o1*My local vape shop telling it like it is*"“Flavors make it appeal to children”

Yeah, because adults ONLY eat “nothing” flavored ice-cream and their favorite candy MUST be sugar cubes. Anything flavored differently, and they’re just children. "
a2x4o1*My local vape shop telling it like it is*"Everyone knows nicotine products can only be sold to people 18 and up. 

How do they get into minors hands? Easy. Someone buys it for them. Just like they do with alcohol. 

I’m tired of seeing people accuse companies for getting minors hooked on it, it wasn’t them, your regulations aren’t going to do anything. It wasn’t Juul, it wasn’t vape shops, look at your own kid and blame him. Take action for once. "
a2x4o1*My local vape shop telling it like it is*Pretty much nailed it for this 40+ ex-Camel smoker.
a2x4o1*My local vape shop telling it like it is*It was never about safety for children, it's about money. They can't tax it like they can cigarettes so therefore they want it shut down. If this was really an endemic about safety they would just straight outlaw cigs and alcohol.
a2x4o1*My local vape shop telling it like it is*"This happens in my country also (Italy)...

Shops self-regulated not to sell to minors even before an actual law was developed.

Nontheless you almost always happen to hear how ""vaping is bad; vaping aims to give addiction to children; vaping cause more cancer than actual smoking"" and similar bullshit...

Altria Group Inc. is always behind this politically...
They are losing a lot of customers but they are still incredibly powerful and fierce in their battle to carry on the *greatest fraud in human history* : cigarette smoking. "

Somebody was always willing....now I can't stand the taste and love the sugar cookie vape 😂 although this habit cost me a shit ton more then just smoking becuase I change my flavor every other day... Sitting on 20 jucies with half I hate.... I should have stayed smoking money wise... Health wise in 15 years? I've never felt better and that's truth for the first time I can keep up climbing the hills with my hunting buddies.. And Enegry? My God where did it come from??? I should have quit years ago.... Fuck ciggerattee companies... I'm vaping.

a2x4o1*My local vape shop telling it like it is*I used vaping to stop smoking and now I use neither. But when I tell people how I used vaping to stop I still proceed to get lectured about “how bad vaping is”, like bitch I know it’s not ideal that’s why I stopped but wtf are you telling ME for? Like I haven’t done my own research about what I put into my body. Not to mention they seem to forget how many magnitudes worse cigarettes are.
a2x4o1*My local vape shop telling it like it is*"Why would they try to stop smoking with something that *doesn't* taste even worse? How else are they supposed to punish themselves constantly for the weakness of smoking in the first place like shunned catholics whipping themselves bloody in repentance? The only way to quit *anything* is a hairshirt and the forgiveness of jesus. Sin *is* the evil root of addiction after all. **/s**

a2x4o1*My local vape shop telling it like it is*"The ""think of the children!"" fallacy has been used pretty much everytime anyone has wanted something regulated or banned. If they really cared about public health theyd implement more restrictions on alcohol and cigarettes as well but unlike vaping the states get a huge amount of tax money from those so they turn a blind eye."
a2x4o1*My local vape shop telling it like it is*Honestly I hate smoking. But love vaping. Hell I even vape 0 nicotine because I think it’s a fun hobby.

a2x4o1*My local vape shop telling it like it is*Fudge I was trying to find the article I was ready yesterday that was on study about how the amount of carcinogens is nearly cut in half in the first week of switching to vaping from smoking. And at two weeks it's something like 60 percent. The measured this in urine I do believe looking for certain metabolites. It's alright the same thing happened in the 90s when GM released the EV1 (first kinda mass production electric vehicle for the masses.) Everyone with their hand in the oil cookie jar got it shut down with all sorts of bullshit and now because of popular demand evs are everywhere. I imagine a similar thing will happen with vaping. Well a similar thing it will grow in such popularity. All I can say is it's most certainly the lesser of two evils. Kids are man you tell them no they say yes, I know I was certainly that way when I was a kid. Also, Marlboro wouldn't be looking to buy a majority of juul if this thing wasn't gonna go somewhere.

d5ndvj*It do be like that all the time*"All organic tobacco, paper

Edit: damn you people can’t take a joke"
d5ndvj*It do be like that all the time*"these post shitting on PM are becoming dumber and dumber, the vaping community has become as dumb as media and government. Facts: 700+ vapors have unknown lung disease similar to COPD at the age of 70. Fact: every death that has occurred from said unknown lung disease, besides one, has been linked to thc or cbd carts. Fact: kids have access to e-cigs but less access to juice. Fact: PM sends me constant reminders to quit smoking without offering any of their products. Fact: PM is allowed coupons for nicotine besides cigarettes in Massachusetts as long as its not flavored (mint or menthol is okay, cinnamon is no longer allowed).

&#x200B;

FACT: 751 Cases (51 since 12 hours ago published), have unknown lung disorders similar to COPD at the age of 70.

&#x200B;

FACT: The government needed to react to the illness, not the death of 8 people.

&#x200B;

Very simple to say, we are upset at the government for taking pleasures away. However, 751 and counting cases of COPD at the median age of 19 within 1 year, is alarming. They are doing the right thing by protecting lungs, its just a preventative measure, so we don't continue killing our children with some unknown factor."
d5ndvj*It do be like that all the time*dumb, which state do you live in? maybe Alabama? PM sends regular updates to my email regarding their soil and tobacco. Im 90% vapor and have cigarettes with people who ask me to have one  (26 year smoker pack a day started at 11, now 40). There are no ingredients on any juice. I have made my own since I realized Juice was overpriced, spoiled, or not good. DIY is the only way to go, its better than growing your own tobacco for yield purposes and less costly for spoilage for loose inventory.
cu4hoy*Big facts*tale as old as time unfortunately. Corrections (or clarifications) never are as headline grabbing as the original reporting
cu4hoy*Big facts*[deleted]
cu4hoy*Big facts*"I'm tired of seeing this crap everywhere, it's a wonder how this has suddenly become a problem when ""kids"" have been vaping for years...hmmm strange. It's an agenda push and that's it"
cu4hoy*Big facts*Well tbh they don’t know what they were smoking lol
cu4hoy*Big facts*"Even my 60 year old mother brought this up and said ""wasn't it weed though? Why are they aiming it at e-cigs?""

At least some people get that it's fear mongering"
cu4hoy*Big facts*"I’m a commercial diver, used to work in the Gulf of Mexico on oil platforms, and have trained extensively in hyperbaric procedure and mixed gas decompression.  I am also required to pass a ridiculously rigid dive physical every year, which includes a vital lung capacity test- among other things.

I used to smoke cigarettes (roll ups) and *struggled* to pass my physicals, and really just breathe in general.  Smoking Fucks.Your.Lungs.Up.  Bad.  Diving in a hard hat can be difficult for smokers because you have to *pull* the air into your lungs.  You’re using muscles to breathe, it’s not just airy zero pressure.  Ever since I started vaping and diving, it has been easier for me.  Whoever is on comms always comments on my breathing.  Sloooow long inhale- hold it for a few seconds- then long slow exhale.  I just imagine I’m hitting my mod, and as stupid and simple as that may seem, it’s an important part of my career.  I’ve been told my breathing through the radio makes people want to sleep because it’s so deep and regular.  Meanwhile while other guys are exerting themselves, they’re struggling for breath and hyperventilating.

I’ve never had any issues vaping then diving and using a chamber.  Quite the opposite.  I wish there were studies on long term usage of people in situations like my own.  I think its an advantage.  Not a detriment."
cu4hoy*Big facts*I’ve been vaping for almost 3 years. I still use 3 nic juice & ive had several thc carts myself, all I know is I feel much better than when I was smoking 2 packs of cigs a day. However, I still worry about the long term effects of vaping.. like someone else said inhaling anything foreign into your lungs is not ideal. I just love vaping & trying new flavors! The black market for THC carts is very worrisome though. The THC carts are going around in my town like hot cakes, most for 30-40$.. who knows where they are coming from.
cu4hoy*Big facts*I like this meme format 🤣
cu4hoy*Big facts*For real though. I’m tired of this being on the news every night. They only mentioned the thc cartos on first two nights being aired.
cu4hoy*Big facts*My money is on lipid pneumonia caused by hippies putting MCT oil in the cartridges because it's a health trend.
cu4hoy*Big facts*Okay so is this true? I have been vaping for about 5-6 years now and all these new headlines have been worrying me. But I only use juice from a real vape store and I use a smok t priv. Should I be worried?
cu4hoy*Big facts*If you buy off the black market your taking a chance to be sold absolutely anything
cu4hoy*Big facts*r/oilpen needs to get in on this and find out who should be held accountable.
cu4hoy*Big facts*Sauce? Just curious. Wife and I were talking about this not long ago, and that it matters what exactly they were vaping and such
cu4hoy*Big facts*I'm so glad you guys are here. My wife is freaking out at me over those news stories and I knew I could come here for clarification.

8okt5g*Cotton 101*This post reminded me to check my cotton, I thank you 
8okt5g*Cotton 101*Great chart! I just printed this out and will pin up on the wall :)
8okt5g*Cotton 101*"My friend is always ""try this new juice"" I hit his vape and always tell him the same thing, ""it taste burnt"" and he always says the same thing ""taste fine to me"". Then I see him re-juice and when he pops the cap off the RDA it's always very very dark almost black cotton. I don't understand. "
8okt5g*Cotton 101*Corgi fur: the next big thing in wicking! Hahaha
8okt5g*Cotton 101*"I was at a party and tried my friends baby beast, and it was the second worst dryhit of my life, i asked him when he changed the coil the last time, and he was like; ""i dunno, like 4 months ago"" i can safely say that baby beast coils do not have a lifespan of 4 months"
8okt5g*Cotton 101*whats a good source on cottons and coils? Just got a rebuildable, nailed the first two cotton jobs and coils, but last 3 cottons burned quick or spit horribly. 
8okt5g*Cotton 101*This is... pretty accurate haha
8okt5g*Cotton 101*😂😂😂
8okt5g*Cotton 101*Surprisingly accurate
8okt5g*Cotton 101*I swear mine jumps right from fresh to re-wick in a matter of days. I blame Twelve Monkey's for doing it.
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*Glad the ban lifted here in MI. It was a retarded waste of time for the two weeks it was in effect. All's they effectively did was make businesses liquidate and terminate leases only to find out they can't just pull that fascist bullshit with the vape industry.
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*Now I want strawberry shortcake.
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*It's funny, in the UK, we are buying flavours from American  companies like tfa and capella that they can't sell in their homeland
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*This would be Hilarious, if it wasn't True...
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*Anyone know a strawberry shortcake vape juice? Ended up buying cotton candy flavor after the last post like this
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*"Hm.. as far as I know just flavoured ready2vape is being banned right? So technically a similar inconvenience which has happened to us (EU) with different reasons is happening to the US. Flavour shots will be sold in the future since nicBase is still available. Correct me if i am wrong.
The main problem is stores sitting on storages full of R2V Juice with no time to adjust and risking existence. And manufacturers have no time to adjust to the FlavS system and are also losing money in the meantime, because deliveries are being canceled. So in fact actual vaping of flav Juice is still legal. But not -selling- flav R2V. Am I correct?
I am getting confused about the rage of not being able to vape flav Juice in broad daylight anymore. You can. But it's not R2V in local stores anymore. The real sht is that the gov isn't giving the stores and manufacturers time to adjust. They are getting stomped over. So help your local stores to survive by buying available R2V before deadline. We are a community that's being frowned upon due to misinformation in media. We had some good years, but now we should all band together. I for myself am letting a friend buy me some R2V in the US. Because to be honest.. US made Juices are just too good and my money will be well invested."
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*"In my state, pot is legal and flavored vapes are banned.

Isn’t that just incredible?

Although technically the courts have decided that the “ban” can’t be legally enforced. Fuck you Whitmer"
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*"I’m 24. And I get that it may not be literally forcing people back to smoking. But a lot of people don’t want to/ feel like they can’t quit and will go right back to cigs. So while it’s not completely forcing them into smoking it’s definitely pushing them in that direction. You probably can’t find anything concrete on a federal ban because they haven’t said anything concrete about it. 

And the whole medical marijuana angle of it, do you really want vape juice market to be like medical marijuana was in the beginning? Legal on the state level but still having federal government come in and fuck with their businesses? 

The bottom line is that it is bullshit and in the end if vaping is banned a lot of vapers will go back to smoking."
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*"Strawberry shortcake & ""BACON"",  TRUTH, thanks for sharing!👌👀👊"
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*so true
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*Ban here in Washington state. Killed the industry. All the local shops are closed down, only one left is the shop that also sold glassware, doubt they will be around much longer. Ended up having to order flavorless juice from online and the flavors separately. This shit is making me cough
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*Oi, ya got a loicense for that watermelon and raspberry?
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*I really hope the Massachusetts state senate doesn’t pass this asinine law but with the way things have been going...I feel hopeless.
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*Show me one single adult who likes strawberry shortcake. One.
dn9fis*Current state of vaping*Online shopping is still allowed in the US right? That's what I miss living in the EU, at least Finland. Buying anything vaping related online here is criminal. Yay to the freedom of the beloved EU! Yay Merkel!
eppld5*US government be like*"At first I thought “wow now they are going to finally say someone died from marijuana” but I was wrong.

Instead they attacked nicotine flavored vapes, which have nothing to do with vaping weed or flavors."
eppld5*US government be like*From my understanding they only banned pre filled pods.... And the vape companies are now replacing those with.... Prefilled pods without a rechargable battery. Am I missing something?! It seems like they really just banned rechargable battery's.
eppld5*US government be like*"yah, not long ago people were trowing at my face the ""40 people died in the usa of vaping"" and i was all like, yes thanks for siding with me, only 40, in contrast with the millions that died every year of cigarettes. People not be smart."
eppld5*US government be like*Even if it was nicotine vaping that killed them why ban it when those numbers are drastically smaller than tobacco deaths. (Just for clarity I'm not saying that nicotine vaping killed anyone)
eppld5*US government be like*"I love guns.

Politicians shit on my hobby and threaten to make me a felon. 

I vape.

For ""my safety"" I'm told that I shouldn't. 


Maybe the government -isn't- our friend."
eppld5*US government be like*"Hmm, illegally produced and sold thc cartriges with harmful additives in them are killing some people?  Let’s make a all thc cartriges and flavored vapes illegal!  That will definitely solve the problem of illegally produced thc cartridges.  I mean come on.  We already traded this in the 70s.  If people want to smoke meth, they’ll find a way.  If people want to smoke thc carts, they’ll find a way, and some have died trying.  The answer is so obviously simple:


1. Legalize.
2. Regulate.
3. Let the market drive costs down.
4. Tax the shit out of it.


We win bc we get to smoke legally everywhere, businesses win because they can capitalize on that demand that drives people to go to the black market, and the government wins because it’s people are happy with it, the economy gets a boost, and they make fat stacks from the tax revenue it brings in as well as being able to regulate what goes in to these products.  

When we ban something, we can’t regulate it because it’s not even legal produce it in the first place.  Instead of giving people a safer option, it’s either the Risky option or nothing at all."
eppld5*US government be like*I thought it was black market nicotine vapes tho. Either way, the meme is accurate
eppld5*US government be like*Literally smfh
eppld5*US government be like*This is BS, death kills people. A little bit of steam ain’t the problem.
eppld5*US government be like*Never will. Tobacco owns the country, whether we smoke ourselves.
eppld5*US government be like*I mean at least since the 60s that's been correct, it was actually illegal to mark the cause of death as smoking.
eppld5*US government be like*"I feel like flavored alcohol is a better parallel for most people.  I'd wager more people drink than smoke and some of it seems to be exclusively consumed by young people. 


Ban both if you want to save young lives or fuck off"
eppld5*US government be like*Die too quick to be profitable.
eppld5*US government be like*The government can’t even pay its own bills. Probably the last group that needs to be telling others how to live their lives.
eppld5*US government be like*"Welcome to being a legal firearm owner.

cl3825*Stolen from r/Memes*"So if it takes about ~50 hits on a 0.6 ohm coil to go through a mL of juice, that’s 50,000 hits to reach a liter of juice. If you are awake for 16 hours, that’s 57600 seconds. You would have to take a hit about every second for 16 hours straight. Your entire day would be limited to sitting in one spot, constantly firing your device.

At 12mg of nicotine/mL, you’d be ingesting 62.5*12 = 750 mg of nicotine, which puts you in the middle of the lethal dose (500mg-1000mg) of nicotine.

In conclusion, y’all be wildin’."
cl3825*Stolen from r/Memes*Caught me while vaping mango.
cl3825*Stolen from r/Memes*Papaya,cantaloupe,mango all in one for me

cl3825*Stolen from r/Memes*Swap mango for grape, and that’s me.
cl3825*Stolen from r/Memes*I was pretty surprised to see an anti-vaping post at #2 on r/all yesterday. The shift to shaming vaping and not even talking about cigarettes is weird.
cl3825*Stolen from r/Memes*My triglycerides are currently way way up there
cl3825*Stolen from r/Memes*i literally just bought a bottle of fruit monster mango lmao

cl3825*Stolen from r/Memes*Is that a man with tits?
8ni04n*Who can relate?*I run mine until I kill it then replace it. Am I the only one? Lol
8ni04n*Who can relate?*B...b...but I need a smaller more pocket friendly setup for nights out? And I work a dirty manual job so I need a sturdy beater mod for that? And what about when I'm drinking at my vape bros place? I need a cloud chucker for that! Thinking about it you really need a backup mod aswel just incase? This other mod actually takes 27100 batteries for better life so I need that one aswel incase i need to go on a longroad trip. Right guys? 
8ni04n*Who can relate?*Two is one and one is none people remember this 
8ni04n*Who can relate?*No it is all the future medical bills we saved that we spend on our devices 😎
8ni04n*Who can relate?*Like I tell my girlfriend. It's a hobby (an expensive one) 
8ni04n*Who can relate?*I've had enough willpower to only have 2 mods...atomizers on the other hand...
8ni04n*Who can relate?*i normally only use a box till it dies buuutttt if i had more money i would have a room dedicated to the shit 
8ni04n*Who can relate?*"too relatable. just bought another mod the other day after saying to myself ""ok, you just bought a DNA250c paranormal, you wont need another mod for a while"", foolish past me."
8ni04n*Who can relate?*Im at that point where i cant decide what mod i want to use and therefore i have a problem...
8ni04n*Who can relate?*I know this is probably said a lot, but if you just start making your juice, your costs will disintegrate. It costs me 2 dollars to make a 60 ml. Also maybe it would drive down the cost of pre-made juice. Those companies are gorging people. 
8ni04n*Who can relate?*I used to be like this and had to have every high end device on the market. But when the market changed to cater to the hobby and eliminated higher strength juices that a lot of smokers need, I went right back to cigarettes. I complained to the shops I go to about pulling all their 12mg juices I always bought but it fell on deaf ears. It wasn't until nicotine salts became a thing that I could finally quit again.
8ni04n*Who can relate?*Epic meme is epic
8ni04n*Who can relate?*Truth 
8ni04n*Who can relate?*I bought a T-Priv kit. I’ll run it until it dies and then I’ll replace it. One setup at a time.
8ni04n*Who can relate?*I have 3 mods, 2 tanks, and 4 RDAs...and that's only because of budget. Otherwise those numbers would be a lot higher.

9rt8og*🤔*Filled my SMOK tank up recently and within 45 minutes of it just sitting there, it had all leaked over my desk. I feel this post
9rt8og*🤔*"Oh, you wanna tilt your tank more than 32°??

GET JUICED MUTHAFUCKA"
9rt8og*🤔*I’ve been using a big baby for over a year now, still haven’t had any major leaking issues, only really minor ones which couldn’t be treated as a proper leak
9rt8og*🤔*Dude yes! Just bought a TV12 prince not too long ago and it leaked more than a virgin on prom night. Ended up replacing it with a fireluke mesh and it is LEAGUES better.
9rt8og*🤔*"Walks into vape shop

Me: ""My SMOK tank is leaking constantly.""

Shop: ""Odd, mine doesn't do that.""

Me: ""This is the third SMOK tank I've bought from you that leaks""

Shop: ""That's unlucky, try this new SMOK tank which has been redesigned to prevent leakage.""

Me: ""If leaking is odd why did they redesign it that way?""

Shop: ""... Maybe what you want is this Crown tank?"""
9rt8og*🤔*My old Revenger X leaked so hard, left that sucker in the car over night and found juice gotten to the internals and shorted it out, rip in piece my faithful boye.
9rt8og*🤔*never really had a problem with smok at all. my prince tanks have never leaked, my mods are all durable and a good hit
9rt8og*🤔*I personally cannot relate to this but my brother in law could back when the TFV8 came out. Mine was great and his would leak so damn bad!
9rt8og*🤔*Hahahaha so true
9rt8og*🤔*I've never had my TFV12 king leak... Previous/smaller models do tho.
9rt8og*🤔*[removed]
9rt8og*🤔*So I think we’re all in agreement. SMOK is garbage tech, tanks and coils. All in favor? 
9rt8og*🤔*I know this is a shitpost, but honestly TFV12 doesn't leak at all.
9rt8og*🤔*Fresh meme? Yes please. Take my upvote!
9rt8og*🤔*Just got rid of my smok tank because it was a gamble every time I filled it whether or not all my juice would be dripping down my mod in hour or not
d791p7*Truth.*"Got to my girlfriends parents after a trip and the first thing her mom said was ""oh my have you heard about all those deaths from vaping?!? You need to quit"" ........ You. Know. NOTHING. Few things annoy me more than someone willingly buying into media bs without doing any sort of research to educate themselves before slinging unsolicited 'advice' around."
d791p7*Truth.*"Aren't a lot of the big cigarette companies involved in the vaping industry now anyway? Seems counterproductive they'd cheer something that would be detrimental to their own profits.

For example the parent company of Marlboro invested 12.8 billion last year into buying 35% of Juul.

 [https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/20/juul-altria-investment-vaping-big-tobacco/](https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/20/juul-altria-investment-vaping-big-tobacco/)"
d791p7*Truth.*I have never seen a better use of this meme.
d791p7*Truth.*Fuck it if we get banned, let’s ban cigarettes
d791p7*Truth.*I don’t know if this is accurate, if only because it’s the tobacco companies that are paying to go after vaping.
d791p7*Truth.*Stupid kids buying dank carts getting our flavors banned
d791p7*Truth.*"All the closed disposable systems owned by the tobacco companies also don't offer 0mg nicotine cartridges.  The tobacco companies have no plan of helping people get off nicotine.

And they will all use nic-salts which the throat and lungs absorb a lot more nicotine from than freebase juice.

It's taking over a decade for tobacco companies to catch up to the vaping industry.  Now that they have, they're using their endless cash flow to influence their vast array of political connections.

Utah just banned open systems. All they had to do was to cite some technicality in a previous law passed that vaping companies agreed with.  Basically an over looked Loophole."
d791p7*Truth.*Who’s ready to move to the UK?
d791p7*Truth.*This in India RN
d791p7*Truth.*They paid them to do it, no surprise to them.
d791p7*Truth.*"*Implying they aren't responsible*"

d791p7*Truth.*If you live in a state that bans e liquid, can you still just order it online from a state that still allows it ?
d791p7*Truth.*"I'm in San Francisco visiting my little sister, and almost everyone out here has been led to believe vaping is deadly. I drove here from Atlanta, stopping at all the tourist sites and vape shops along the way. People's thoughts on vaping gradually got worse as I was heading west

EDIT : Every 5 minutes you see the same commercial talking about Juul marketing to kids and basically being the devil"

magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*"I find it incredibly ironic and twisted that above it is a sign saying ""build a better daily routine"". How sick is that?"
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*Picked up some beer the other day and the store offered some dank new watermelon white claws. Meanwhile there's a purposed flavor ban for Canada on top of our already dumb regulations. What a time to be alive

magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*HAHAAHAHA the hypocrisy continues.
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*Insane isn't it, and all u have to do is provide a government issued identification card and prove your old enough and you can purchase it as a free, legal american.. drives me bananas.
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*"Damn, I was building my daily routine wrong all this time!

Finally gonna be feeling amazing omw to work in the morning, all I needed is a 6 pack of cocktails!"
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*So becauae I’m an adult I can’t have flavors?  This makes no sense.  Why do only kids like flavors?  Is this some kind of sick joke?
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*Oh god just imagine if it was vapes there instead of alcohol
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*"This has been my major complaint regarding the targeted harassment of vaping. They claim that it's being done in order to prevent the enticing of minors, and to do so they want to relegate flavors to basically ""tobacco"" and ""menthol"", or even unflavored completely.

Meanwhile, flavored alcohol is not only available and prevalent, but it's clearly advertised on TV as a fun and enjoyable experience. The labeling and cans are really no different from the same kind of design you would associate with a carbonated beverage or an energy drink.

I can't even recall the last time I've seen an anti-alcohol advert, but anti-vaping is everywhere. 

I personally don't drink at all, and I'm not against people who do, but I can't stand the hypocrisy."
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*Where do i aquire the watermelon jack. Seriously want to try it
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*Alcohol can ruin lives, whether it be through addiction or the stupor it puts you in. But yet alcohol can advertise, use flavours and be ordered online as far as I know. All these freedoms, even though the reality is it'll have you throwing up in your toilet.
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*We tried going against industries too large and established. If they really cared that about nicotine being bad for kids they would have gone straight to the source, through the original market that brought it to prominence. But they don’t care about the kids, or us. They only care about what they’ve already been able to reel in and profit themselves off of.
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*Absolutely! Trader Joe's by my house won't sell tobacco it's against the companies ethics, but they sell a SHIT TON of booze and wine. School is next door. Guess what litters the little  pass between the school and Trader Joe's..... that's right a shit ton of glass alcohol bottles. This exact brand too! Remember Seagram's wine coolers? And the catchy tune they had with the commercials?
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*At some point in my life, I was nearly a daily drinker; now I work beside a state run liquor store, and to see the daily customers and just people denying their alcoholism that will nearly always lead to an early demise, It’s gross. It’s gross to see the juxtaposition between the incentivizing of alcohol compared to any other drug or in this case vaping. Mass advertising, I cannot watch any live event without thousands of alcohol advertisements pulling up, and I mean shit, in my state alcohol every single year is a top business, but the legitimate health hazards and hazards alcohol excuses mean nothing compared to the top dollar it seems to bring in. Look I’m not saying alcohol is even bad, I just think the blatant contradiction of being free to choose whichever flavor of delicious pre-made liquor mix, and then the contrary in my case of having to drive over an hour total to get a decent bottle of juice in the near future with the mail ban, is bullshit.
magput*"""flavouring is advertising to minors!"""*Yeah but that doesn't apply to the big alcohol companies because they're the ones doing it. If big tobacco could have figured out how to make cigarettes taste like watermelon you'd best be sure they'd have done it years ago. Vaping wouldn't even be a problem if they were the ones who had invented and marketed it, and if the regulations around it were written to protect them.
dm2aov*"*pats body all over*"*"I am always in a rush in the morning to get out the door, which unfortunately means I have forgotten my vape a couple times. It annoyed me enough to the point where I now leave it standing up in my shoe so I wont forget it again.

9h7zm4*My grandfather has smoked Marlboro Reds since before I was born. He finally caved and asked me for a hit.*"I got my grandma to try it as well and bought her a starter kit afterwards. Unfortunately she didn't even finished 10ml of juice.

She really vaped just half a day but struggled with the throat hit and coughed hard every time, no matter what juice. I told her this is normal and she just has to try for some days and it will go away, but she just didn't want to go for 2-3 days without a proper smoke and also does not bother thinking about quitting anymore. 

She turns 80 in 2 months and talks a lot about dying. Its quite depressing. 

I hope you grandfather makes the switch."

aacefv*I've lost this battle a few times*I’ve blown my vape right into mine and it still won’t go off.
aacefv*I've lost this battle a few times*Mine loves to go off but only at 2am when everyones asleep. good times.
aacefv*I've lost this battle a few times*"My smoke detector not only goes off from a little vape but also is right around the corner from the stove and legit goes off anytime I pan sear anything. I live in an apartment building so I’m terrified of it setting off the whole building 

“Sir I was cooking” is a lot easier to tell the fire chief then “I was just chucking some mean clouds bro” "
aacefv*I've lost this battle a few times*My dorm has smoke alarms that are chemical sensitive (or fume, whatever) so vapor doesn’t set them off thankfully 
aacefv*I've lost this battle a few times*"I have ptsd myself and one day my wife was vaping at night and the thing whent off in the hallway.
I litteraly destroyed the thing in a haze of murderous aggression...

Havent had a problem since tho"
aacefv*I've lost this battle a few times*beepy boi always wins. it's even more fun cuz i have an alarm monitoring system, so they call to check if everything's ok. and if i don't answer the phone in time (cuz i'm trying to shut it off), they send the FD. 
aacefv*I've lost this battle a few times*If my fan isnt on and I rip a fat cloud then its beepy boi central. If my fans on it doesnt go off.
aacefv*I've lost this battle a few times*This is how my parents took away my vape. I had one when I was in high school... for literally one day. I got it one day in the summer and was really excited to use it. I was vaping in my bedroom after my parents went to bed, and it set off the smoke alarm in my room. Needless to say, that was the last of my vaping days. lol 
aacefv*I've lost this battle a few times*"People that stay at my hotel don't believe that's a thing. Like multiple times a week we get a fire alert system and a call from the alarm company, and then when I call the room I always ask ""were you vaping?"" Because 99 percent of the time they were and lied about it lol"
aacefv*I've lost this battle a few times*I’ve set the smoke detector off 4 times since I started college from vaping 💀 First time I made my ex burn popcorn while I went down to the desk to talk to the cop. The next three times I told them it was dry shampoo and they somehow believed me or just didn’t care.

d3mlct*Sounds about right.*I work as a respiratory therapist at a large hospital and can say I’ve seen thousands of patients come in with Dyspnea and trouble breathing after smoking cigarettes. I’ve seen maybe three people come in after vaping, but they had a childhood history of asthma. Who knows what the long term effects of vaping cause, but from what I’ve seen so far, vaping has helped former smokers. I’ve talked to many people who have switched from smoking to vaping. Many have completely quit from the transition, and almost all have said they feel healthier by switching.
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*They are when the government taxes cigarettes but doesn't pay for your healthcare.
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*And here we are. Soon-to-be illegal pioneers of the e-cigarette prohibition. It's sad. In Michigan, I'll still blow clouds out of my window on the drive home with no fucks given. I'm happy that I have contacts in the industry, so all of this illegality won't stop me. I feel bad for the kids who don't vape vitimin E acetate who are going to be goated into smoking cigarettes bc our dipshit country lobbied the better choice with Phillip Morris in mind.
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*History will repeat itself if this stuff is illegal. In the 1920's the prohibition made alcohol so much more dangerous than it could have been. I personally don't believe in abortion, but when it was illegal, women who wanted an abortion had to resort to back alley termination. Government really should regulate these products for our own safety not make them illegal. Marijuana should also be made legal for the nation's safety so illegal cartridges are tremendously cut down.
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*Disgusting.
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*I’m not sure why nobody is addressing what should be the most urgent part of this story. KIDS are buying bad street drugs. The CDC website says every tested example proves that they vaped THC or Vitamin E. Vaping is an action. What you put in it is the point.
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*And boom goes the dynamite! You hit the nail on the head!
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*They don't give a shit about you.
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*The health care industry is very profitable as well - it pays to have people sick.
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*I'm glad that I quit smoking tobacco over a year ago
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*Not that I’m challenging the info here, can I get some names of the “world leading research centers” so I can have some ammo for the fight?
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*Unfortunately, government pockets have always been more important than public health and that goes beyond traditional and electronic cigarettes
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*The government anti tobacco campaign has always been smoke and mirrors. The government depends on the billions in tax dollars, and the politicians are collecting from the lobbyists. Big pharma is in on the action too. Smoking is far too profitable for it ever to be eliminated. They’ve probably determined that there is a large enough percentage of new nicotine users that they can go ahead and crush vaping and the newbies will transition right into cigarettes. Saving lives is at the very bottom of their list of priorities,which I’m sure includes keeping a lid on cancer cures
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*I normally hate it when people argue with the government for banning harmful stuff but this is stupid. If everyone who smokes turned to vaping, those millions of yearly deaths would be abolished. Providing you don’t buy your e liquid from basement chemist drug dealers.
d3mlct*Sounds about right.*"I'll just leave you guys with this.

Vaping = 6 deaths

Cigarettes = 500,000+ deaths annually"

Tomorrow I’ll be on WILX 10 for an interview to defend our stance. Wish me luck and leave some tips for my stance in the comments!!!*"focus on the Hypocrisy of the ban and mention how Candy Cigarettes and sweet flavored cigarillos are still on store shelves.

dont bring up vapings safety concerns unless a question comes to you in which case point out the CDCs report on the fact these illnesses were caused by THC carts NOT Ejuice or salt nics.

if the question of minors being more attracted to candy flavors etc remind them the target demographic for the vape industry happens to be in their mid to late 20s and we ALSO like those flavors and how it is OUR fault that the industry packaging is so blatantly ""pro-teen"".

also you may or may not wish to bring up the fact that Mich gov has had donations from both big pharma and Big tobacco and that this legislation specifically targets their BIGGEST competition and how that makes it a matter of the state intervening in competition to benefit their benefactors.

GOOD LUCK!"

Tomorrow I’ll be on WILX 10 for an interview to defend our stance. Wish me luck and leave some tips for my stance in the comments!!!*"Agree with /u/initialddriver 

I can run down to the liquor store and buy cotton candy and whipped cream flavored vodka but god forbid someone 18+ wants to vape something that doesn't taste like dirt. Taste buds don't die at 18, legal users enjoy a variety of flavors (including sweet and fruity), and bright and attractive packaging.

Nicorette gum comes in flavors like ""Fruit Chill, Cinnamon Surge, and White Ice Mint"". Vape juice and nicotine gum are both nicotine products. Where is the regulation on Nicorette gum flavoring? 

We don't want special treatment, we want equality.

&#x200B;

Kids in every high school until 2010 were smoking strawberry flavored prime times and cherry flavored chewing tobacco, now there is a healthier, less-smelly, better tasting alternative to that. The same reason why millions of smokers switched to vaping all over the world are the same reasons why kids choose vaping over smoking. It is superior in every way. I'd say its a best-case alternative, not an epidemic.

The main safety concerns come down to black market products and misuse of high-powered batteries. Vaping becoming mainstream has made the hobby safer overall because of better manufacturing products, more safety measures on lower-cost devices, and better manufacturing/safety standards on juice. The kids who suffered health related concerns came from black-market THC products, not off the shelf vape products."

Tomorrow I’ll be on WILX 10 for an interview to defend our stance. Wish me luck and leave some tips for my stance in the comments!!!*"Dress up. Wear nice clothes. Shit shower shave. Floss brush rinse. Appearances are huge on msm. Print out sources of all your claims. Reputable sources only. Ask her for a list of questions she'll be asking you, and prepare/practice your answers. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast, enunciate your speech and think of your target audience in your delivery. Be cautious about approaching the corruption angle, as far as big tobacco protecting profits and their ownership of these legislators/policy makers. Speak of it with nuance, keep the argument balanced. People will automatically think youre a tin foil wearing crackpot - the masses generally make any excuse possible to avoid confronting the truth - theyd rather believe the narrative being given. America refuses to acknowledge the level of corruption within our state and federal governments and speaking on it at length will hurt your argument. You have to beat them at their own game. 

Also keep in mind these media outlets are more than likely being forced to push that narrative, as msm is usually a tool to miseducate the population, and your conversation will more than likely be edited. Like court .... 'anything you say can and will be used against you.' Good luck!"

Wish me luck and leave some tips for my stance in the comments!!!*"You could mention that a lot of people have used it to quit cigarettes (myself, 2 of my coworkers, my boss' wife included) and that flavor variety helps people from going back to cigs. 
You could mention that prohibition is a bad idea and that black market THC juice is what caused the illnesses, but by making people not have access to the juices will increase those numbers as people try to make their own juice. 
You could mention that ultimately the responsibility falls on the parents to talk to underage kids about vaping and nicotine addiction, just like it falls on them for alcohol or diet or just about anything else. Hiding behind the excuse of ""for the children"" isn't a valid reason to ban stuff for adults.
And final argument is that this will cost people their jobs and weaken Michigan's economy, even if by a little.  There are at least 10 vape shops in my area, how many will cut hours or let go of employees due to reduced sales? 

All in all I think you should expect whatever they say to be an absolute smear campaign and you need to keep your cool and make sure you try to minimize ""sound bites"" that make you look bad.

Wish me luck and leave some tips for my stance in the comments!!!*"u/purgecarter I would mention that this ban would make it considerably more difficult for people who legitimately want to quit smoking cigarettes.

When you are confronted about the people who are sick I would be as clear as possible about the fact that they were linked to THC pods, not what a regular vape is.

I would focus on the need to enforce currently existing laws and encourage government agencies to work with small businesses to ensure that no one under the age of 18 can purchase a tobacco product or a vape. Be clear that the vaping community stands behind not allowing minors to consume any nicotine product.

As a former smoker, the tobacco flavors did not do it for me and just kept bringing me back to cigarettes. I would stress the importance of flavors in helping us former smokers quit. I would stress that many of us went from 1 or two packs a day and through diligence are down to very low levels of nicotine in many cases.

I would shy away from mentioning any study, or any scientific information about whether or not vaping is safe or safer as this will raise more questions than it will answer. If you are asked I would shift to that many former cigarette smokers feel much better after an extended period of not consuming tobacco products and that the community supports the research being conducted by universities across the globe.

I would keep the donations from tobacco products in your back pocket, but would not bring it up unless if you have no other choice. It is very possible that this politician also received money from doctor groups/PACs and you don't want to be hit with ""oh but they also were funded by doctors therefore it must be in line with the opinion of at least some medical professionals"".

I will think of more pointers..."

I started dipping and smoking at 13. My favorite dip at the time was either Skoal apple, vanilla, cherry or if I had to, berry.

Then they talk about expanded tobacco that is ""pumped up."" If that's what they are willing to show you imagine what they won't. Also just think of all the crap they use in the those processes that is probably a ""trade secret."" Also they mention adding flavors at various points.

cga932*New vapers be like...*"I did a shit ton of research. Got my first AIO device. A week later I ordered my first mod and rta. 

My mod (dragl batteries, spools of wire and tools all came in but my MTL rta (berserker mini) hadn't been delivered yet. So I ordered a boreas v2 (figured might as well also get a DL rta, wasn't planning to do much dl) the shitty boreas cost me almost 50 euros which is incredibly expensive considering Chinese prices but I was impatient.

Next day my boreas is delivered and some wire i bought for DL vaping. 

Now keep in mind I researched this shit (building, rtas etc) for a week after getting my first vape. 

The white I had bought was ultra thick fused Clapton SS316. It ohmed out at like 0.1 and I couldn't get it higher no matter what I tried. 

So i figure i should dry burn it. And I dry burn it at 157w (max watt on drag 1) using VTC6 batteries. 

**the coils get so fucking hot and glow so bright they melt one of the posts / the peak material turning one post crooked.** my.mod also got hot af both due to the batteries and due to the fact that that much watt is far too much power for a bunch of VTC6. 

LoL 

**the absolute worst part is that my berserker mini was delivered the next day.. the next fucking day. I spend 50 euro on an rta I really hate (mediocre flavor, shit deck, and now crooked deck) just so I could fail trying to build it.**


When I got my berserker I immediately had great success building it with 28g 2.5mm. I tried different builds and wires etc. 

I avoided dl for.months and only once build my boreas v2 as a joke to show  my friends how much vapor it pumped out. Months later I decided to try rdas and fell in love with DL vaping. Now I mainly vape dl"

dfzvhl*You ever just vape straight menthol outside on the coldest days just to feel something?*The CDC said vaping hurts your lungs, so now I'm exclusively butt chucking. Ripping a fat cloud through my ring piece feels so good, and my farts smell like Jam Monster.
dfzvhl*You ever just vape straight menthol outside on the coldest days just to feel something?*My wife and I both vape, and we’re married, so this one hits pretty close to home.
dfzvhl*You ever just vape straight menthol outside on the coldest days just to feel something?*I wish, menthol banned in Michigan but not the cold unfortunately 😀
dfzvhl*You ever just vape straight menthol outside on the coldest days just to feel something?*"I have a deviated septum, which can make breathing very difficult sometimes because the deviation is so bad, and once I started vaping with menthol, it cleared my sinuses soooo much that it allowed me to work out for the first time ever, and it's insane because I always thought there was just something wrong with my head. I have ADHD, but before I even got on medication, I was, and am still able to work out significantly more. I switch to the strongest menthol flavors I can find, and sometimes even find stronger ones to use, which becomes my primary juice, and the cycle repeats. The recent news about banning flavors including menthol is concerning because it means I will require surgery to fix my deviated septum to continue my lifestyle. In the long run, I guess it is much better to get the surgery, but for those who couldn't afford it or lack insurance, there must be others out there who found that strong menthol vaping has had a legitimate, positive impact on their entire life.
Edit: my girlfriend and I enjoy a healthy sex life regardless of the presence of a vape lmao"

Tide is known as ""ghetto cash"".
"
b5d54q*Putting FLAVORED nicotine gum right next to teens' favorite snacks... Talk about marketing to minors*"My asshole can fit a car tire. If anyone actually reads this, keep in mind that an average asshole of a human being can dilate between 2-4 centimeters. One car tire is roughly 500x200 cm. So yeah, fitting a car tire in my asshole is probably a world record and should deserve a Guinness book of world records entry. My first piece of advice if you think you can beat this record is don’t even try. My second piece of advice is (if the first piece of advice is ignored), start small and gradually move on to bigger things. Anal bleeding ruins many articles of clothing including but not limited to socks and shoes. Actually, while we’re on the topic of anal stretching and clothes being ruined, you should know once the anus is stretched beyond 8 cm, the sphincter is rendered useless. Gravity will just pull turds right out of your ass with no regard for anything. If your diet is fiber rich, this may not be as big of a problem, as solid turds can be easily disposed. However, if you are a fan of taco bell, be warned that splash damage is a very real thing. It’s best during the anal stretching period to invest in a wide range of butt plugs.

Not only will this stem the tide of fecal matter making dramatic exits through what can only be described as an industrial laundry chute, but with the proper fitment the plugs will maintain your latest stretch during downtime. Proper resting with a press fit butt plug is good and allows the body to accept the new monstrosity that is the size of your asshole. Anal fissures are a by-product of stretching too rapidly without the necessary downtime and recovery. Anal fissures are extremely painful, especially when infected by wet bowel movements. The only benefit of anal stretching is lack of fart noise. Like a balloon stem, the known fart noise is caused by air movement vibrating the orifice it exits. Noise intensity are directly proportional to air speed velocity, while harshness of pitch is indirectly proportional to size of hole. With an escape hatch the size of a mini-sub, air speed velocity is virtually zero, thus no noise is heard. Any gas produced by the body and exiting the colon tends to just waft out as produced. I’m not even sure the action of “farting” is a thing when your asshole can fit a small adult inside of it. I suppose technically there is some air movement, but it would be no more significant than running a leaf blower through the grand canyon. Finally, it should be cautioned to never leave your expanded asshole uncovered, as birds, fish, and reptiles will nest in discovered cave dwellings. This then becomes a health and safety violation in many public settings that is best to generally avoid. I personally recommend having a sealed traffic cone or small inflatable raft handy when leaving your asshole alone for more than 5 minutes. Butt plugs are an option but only if you are staying under 24 centimeters in diameter. Greater than 24 centimeters, and the butt plug industry will have to create a custom sized plug (which is costly and generally best to avoid). So in conclusion, when going to the extremes of anal stretching, keep realistic goals, but always prepare ahead of time for a size you may think unattainable. Your anus will surprise you."

ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*Flavored candy should be banned, it’s taste and colors attract children who then loose teeth and become obese.
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*Ban all flavored alcohol! Except tobacco flavored. ;)
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*What the fucking flying fuck how come ive never seen those Smirnoff flavors?? And those prices wtfff?
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*got in an argument with a tobacco inspector the other day who was inspecting my vape shop and shit talking flavors, and I brought this up, he didnt have much of a response. I dont understand how just having it flavored automatically means its for children. Everyone likes flavors, thats why they are popular. if it was just for kids then adults would only be buying tobacco flavored juice but thats obviously not the case. its so irritating to talk to people who have that opinion, like do we have to get rid of anything that kids like? Not to mention a lot of tobacco flavors are made from caramel so where do you draw the line there?
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*The fact that states are banning flavors shows that theres a lot of people out there unwilling to do real research about a subject.  And as I remember from the past, prohibition never really works.  It just makes things worse.  Heck, the picture is proof.
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*Kroger banned all Juul products but still has this shit
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*Unflavoured juice ranges from bland to bitter depending on the state of the nicotine, it needs something to be enjoyable. Menthol can annoys my sinuses, makes my nose run and ruins my taste buds, they’ve never got tobacco and coffee right so fruit and dessert flavours are my choice.
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*I honestly hate flavored alcohol it tastes nasty just mix it if you need a flavor in my opinion
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*And let's all remember, flavored tobacco is still legal in all 50 states. This is outright corruption and it clearly shows our public servants are corporate servants.
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*But alcohol causes health issues and makes Big Pharma money, therefore it has to stay. The only things they'll ban are things which are not profitable
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*$10 for a bottle damn, at the LCBO store here in Ontario those go for $27
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*Yo is that Kroger store?
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*"I prefer chocolate 360 vodka. 💕

Sers though where is our memes about adult chocolate milk?"
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*I should’ve added in the title this is Washington state. The same state banning flavored ejuice. But has zero issue with this picture I have taken. What a weird state and world and country and life we live in
ddp1mc*Adults don’t like flavors! Keep making sure everyone knows this!!!*Twitter is the political battle ground.   If you dont have an acct get one.  Every tweet use #WeVapeWeVote.  And if you aren’t registered do it now.   Our lives matter!

cbmgzy*San Francisco*I hate the bay area ngl
cbmgzy*San Francisco*Pardon me, I am european is there some kind of satyrical context that i am missing?
cbmgzy*San Francisco*[deleted]
cbmgzy*San Francisco*"One of the worst parts about the ban in SF is that the city is completely ignoring the basis of what vaping is. The major point of vaping is to get people off cigarettes, period. Without the means of buying new vapes, juice, tools, supplies, etc, most vapers in the city will turn to cigarettes, it is only a matter of time. 

Vape shops in the city have been shutting down and disappearing for years, and this ban is the final push that will put the rest of the vape shops in the city out of business. Even though the price of e-juice has dropped significantly in recent years, all the other state and local regulations have severely damaged the vaping industry not just in SF, but the Bay Area as a whole. Seriously, you can’t even go into a vape shop and get a fresh build/try new juices at shops nowadays. 

The whole point of this new ban in SF is to prevent children from vaping but since when did trying to stop children from doing anything actually help that cause? Teenagers will smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, all that teenage shit because that’s what teenagers do. The point is that we guide them to live better and healthier lives, and banning the sale of e-cigarettes as well as shipments into the city has not contributed to that cause. Once again, they will simply turn to cigarettes to get their nicotine fix. 

While e-cigarettes are not the perfect alternative to cigarettes, they are a start. While there are no legitimate long-term studies on vaping, we still don’t know the health impacts of vaping general VG/PG based juice. However, there is concern when Juul is coming out with cartridges that are testing out at ~55 mg/mL nicotine levels. 

Ultimately, it is not e-cigarettes that are the problem, rather bad legislation and regulations that have almost put most vape shops out of business. If the problem truly lies with children, then put regulations on the nicotine content inside the devices, not the device itself. 55 mg/mL is way too much nicotine for any single person and definitely not safe for children."

cbmgzy*San Francisco*A someone who smokes and vapes all this is telling me the government would rather have me smoke then vape. Why was there no ban for cigs? Why isn’t there a teen smoking epidemic? Oh right education. Why tf is the first response to everything ban?
cbmgzy*San Francisco*"Good lord is this so true. 

Makes 0 fucking sense seeing 2 homeless people fight in the middle of the street after a giants game walking to my car but GOD FORBID I rip my drag.

cbmgzy*San Francisco*Fuck me this thread is trash. Yes, its the liberal bleeding hearts that are doing this. They make rules with their hearts in the right place, but that just creates a new problem with the old one still existing. They mean well, they just don't go about it the right way.

8q17wo*Congatulations to those who have successfully quit smoking!*"Fuck man, this post would of just fucked me up if i smoked yesterday. I quit in 2017 as a new year resolution, and to this day, have only smoked one cigar. I'm in greece right now and a good 80% of people smoke. It's been tempting the last couple of days, but after i dove today, i realised i love my lungs, and octopus tastes to fucking good, and my girl friend won't sleep in the bed if i smoke cigarettes.

Cheers mate, thanks for the post. It really helps me stay strong. "
8q17wo*Congatulations to those who have successfully quit smoking!*"No more cigarettes for me! 

Just Psycho-Jet and Buffout...😂"
8q17wo*Congatulations to those who have successfully quit smoking!*Sometimes I'll have an occasional smoke, I never buy packs. Vaping helped my half a pack a day habit. 👏😁

8q17wo*Congatulations to those who have successfully quit smoking!*Does anyone have a recommendation on where to start with Vaping? I would very much like to stop smoking but all the information is a little intimidating, plus I don't have a lot of money to throw down all at once for an expensive rig, and don't know the difference in juices that are good or bad, I overall don't know enough I guess. Anyone willing to have a conversation about where/how to start, that would be awesome! Cheers ya'll! 
8q17wo*Congatulations to those who have successfully quit smoking!*It's been a year today since I quit smoking after buying my first mod and juice from my local shop. 
8q17wo*Congatulations to those who have successfully quit smoking!*55 days today! Already 2 mods deep  hah, but wouldn’t turn back for the world. 
8q17wo*Congatulations to those who have successfully quit smoking!*Currently at 12 days smoke free since switching :)
8q17wo*Congatulations to those who have successfully quit smoking!*5 months and 9 days 😄
8q17wo*Congatulations to those who have successfully quit smoking!*I guess instead of gone I should have said changed drastically but make no mistake, if the current deeming regs are passed in 2022 vaping as most know and love it will be gone. And if you are a juul or closed look system user go fuck yourself 
8q17wo*Congatulations to those who have successfully quit smoking!*This could make a great sticker on my ecig.

Today, our American Citizens fail and lack the ability to critically think for themselves because the Tube does it for them. Leaving its citizens in ignorance, fear, and paranoia.

dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*"-> Rebuildables.

Never wait again!"
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*Drip liquid directly into the coil until the cotton can’t absorb any more and then you can hit it immediately after assembling and filling.
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*Get an rta :D
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*"Someone told me that too when I first started vaping but luckily I had some veterans to show me the way. For store bought coils all you need to do is drip around the cotton spots on the outside of the coil until they look saturated with juice and then carefully drip about 4 drops of juice inside of the coil. Next step, close the airflow on your tank and do ""dry hits"" which is inhaling with the airflow closed and not hitting the fire button. Do this about 5-10 time or until you can clearly taste the flavor through your dry hits and you're good to go. No need to wait, vape on friend!

Edit: spelling"
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*Laughs in rda
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*Block the air intake holes while its filled with juice and mouth inhale. You'll see bubbles come out by the cotton. Do it a few times and enjoy.
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*"Two tricks. 
#1
Open the blister pack and presoak a coil. 
#2 
Pour in liquid in the tank. Leave chimney open and watch for a drip or two under the tank. Moves it from 15 to a few minutes."

*sits like in the picture staring at her dinky pods.*"
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*When I change the coil in my Falcon King, I leave the top cap open for about 60-90 seconds. Works like a charm...just can't forget about it or you'll leak your entire tank out.
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*That's the look I have now, waiting for my Uncrustables to defrost :(
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*So very true. Just sitting there jonesin’ for that sweet nectar!
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*Everyone is like “no need to wait!” But you have no idea how many people say they primed their coil, burn it right away and come straight back to the store say it’s faulty.
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*relatable, lol good post.
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*"Why wait?

I just prime the tank coils.  Shoot juice down in them and on the outside. Then put it together and fill it. Close the air off and suck on it for about 60 seconds.

Good to go.

First few hits will be juicy and maybe leak a little, but she'll straighten out after a few."
dhudmf*Me waiting 15 minutes after adding the newly arrived liquid to my tank*"Take your coil and put it over your bottle of juice(only if it’s a dropper otherwise a cup or sink). Drip the inside of that fucker until it’s *drenched* and let it sit for 30 seconds. Then put in tank, fill tank with your juice. Hit.

Or when you realize you need to change it soon, soak the inside the night before. Let it steep and then change the cool when your ready for immediate vaping."

dcyu8g*🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️*"At my doctors office I was in for a virus (common cold but I had walking pnemonia last year so I wanted to make sure I wasn't going down that path again) 

I told him I was using an old codeine prescription to numb the cough. He said ""Oh! Well do you need more??"". I was really shocked that I was elligble for codeine with the only symptom being a sore throat."
dcyu8g*🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️*I’m an addict in recovery. I’ve overdosed on opioids twice. I’ve been clean for 1 year and 7 months and part of the reason I’ve been able to stay clean is that I vape and it’s something of an outlet for stress, frustration, etc. It has a calming effect for me. It’s also become somewhat of a hobby. I honestly don’t know at this point what the government can do for opioid addiction bc the cat’s out of the bag. Once people know there’s something that can make them feel that way, it’s very difficult to take it back and act like it never happened. That’s why it’s so hard to get clean. And sick/hurt people actually need those meds so you can’t eradicate them completely. One of the people that sold to me after I lost my scripts (broke my back in a car accident and got endless scripts till my first OD) was a cancer patient. Fentanyl used to be something you could almost never get on the street and was insanely expensive if you could actually find it and now it’s like everywhere. Idk how they can fix it but that’s what they should be focusing on. Not vape flavors. I mean yeah, get control of the kids but not at the expense of millions of adults. I need my vape and flavors. They don’t realize how many lives they’re going to fuck up with these bans. Or actually, they probably do, they just don’t care. They want their MSA payments and for vaping to disappear. We can’t let that happen.

d5e6da*Haha*"""I survived the great fake vape epidemic of 2019"""
d5e6da*Haha*"I think it was ""Today"", this morning had a piece on the VAPING EPIDEMIC that has caused ""7 or more deaths"", it included how teens are vaping in plain sight using vapes that ""look like pens, and highlighters, so parents may not know what to look for"", and they explained how its ""not really a vapor,  but more of an aerosol"".  My god.  I had to switch to sling tv, and watch documentaries about murder.  I am less outraged by true crime than a demonizing of a safe alternative to smoking (which I did for 30 years and only was able to quit by vaping, I tried everything else)....by lying.  Its already illegal for  kids to vape.  They are getting trash that they inhale (illegally)  and getting sick from unsafe additives from counterfeits, and making it harder for those of us are doing legal shit.  Wtf? Banning will only increase the counterfeit market.  People are stupid. I hate misinformation.


EDITED TO ADD : I understand the outrage at these deaths.  How many deaths has smoking caused and its legal?   I started smoking when I was 11, so it being illegal for me to start didn't enter into it.   I don't see myself able to go without nicotine.   Wonder if we can sue the government over driving up smoker percentages if they ban vaping? /s"
d5e6da*Haha*"My girlfriend yesterday reading an article online “looks like (our state) is inspecting all weed products before they hit the marked because of the vape news” 

This is fucking bullshit and honestly I’m beginning to question what the fuck the government is even here for. 

Illegal THC carts hit the black market and then they talk about banning the fucking vapes. Then they finally read past the headline of one of those articles and realized that it’s black market THC. So they start wasting money inspecting legal weed products, ITS NOT FROM LEGAL WEED YOU FUCKING RETARDS!!!!! What a fucking joke. Sometimes I feel like the government is run by fucking children."
d5e6da*Haha*"Re: today show today, calling e-cig juices aerosols, not vapors:

..ahem..

*Aerosol = requires pressure, and typically a propellant*

*Vapor = nothing to do with water alone - like they claimed on today.*

**They claim vapor is only “water” heated up**

**They claim this makes e-cigs “aerosols” because they aren’t water.**

Vapor = liquid, never just water. **Ergo, E-cigs release a vapor. Not an aerosol liquid**

aerosol = propellant and pressure required, none of which are in any e-cigs. **Ergo, e-cig juices aren’t aerosol. There is no pressure or propellant. They are vapor when heated by a device**

I cannot even imagine how much cig companies are dishing out money wise for this total waste of time and energy, to get both kids and adults back on cigs.

This drives me nuts. Out-of-this-world false information.


The CDC’s well-stated scientific argument: “vaping is dangerous. Period.”

Wow. Science, right there

So are beds, period. Because a greater amount of people have died from falling out of bed. Literally. Like....a lot of people. Definitely “greater than 5.”

Everyone just start checking where the money for this is coming from. Let’s track it back to the cig companies, trying to get everyone back on their cigarettes with [599 additional substances located within each single cigarette.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_additives_in_cigarettes)"
d5e6da*Haha*"This generalization and misinformation by the news media is extremely dangerous and likely to result in more people dying from switching back to cigarettes. Let’s not forget that approximately 1,300 people die EVERY DAY from cigarette smoking. 1,300 per day compared to 6 over the past several month.

https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/index.htm"
d5e6da*Haha*That’s what happens when you buy BOOTLEG
d5e6da*Haha*"Man they sure throw the word ""epidemic"" around like it's nothing nowadays. I guess sex and eating are epidemic too but let's talk about how to stop elderly drivers first!"
d5e6da*Haha*"I mean, it's a *real* epidemic... Only people who buy illegal marijuana THC carts are effected though. 

I was a dumb kid once who would try all the drugs, so I feel for them. Now if the news and government would do what they actually need to do instead of trying to ban all vape products, that would be *swell.*"
d5e6da*Haha*"""It´s an Epidemic""

I wonder how many thousands of children died from second hand smoke or alcohol related overdoses or accidents during the time that some teens got sick because they bought a schedule 1 illegal drug in a counterfeit cartridge."
d5e6da*Haha*I think it’s disrespectful to the people that have actually died from this
d5e6da*Haha*How are we 100% sure it’s only the bootleg thc? And not regular schmegular vapes? I ask cuz a bitch just got a sore throat and a mini cold right now and I’m scared not gona lie
d5e6da*Haha*It is beyond frustrating... the misinformation is infuriating.... and I’m a New Jersey resident. Sooooo now senator menendez is cracking down. I’m trying to stock up. Where I live there’s one vape which is 30 mins from me as is and it’s in the complete opposite direction of which way I go.  I order everything off reputable sites. I just think it’s beyond ironic this started as THC carts became more popular. I can bore you all with my story. But I would rather continue to bore congress and not stop until my voice be heard. The perks of living in a small town, is knowing people who started off doing things in a small town, and now are in much bigger cities. Such as news anchors so I’m in touch with one!!! And I’m hoping to get as many as my adult friends who all vape together, I even have people in their 60’s (I’m 42) and I’m trying to explain we have done this for years and not one of us has had any decline in our health but impressive improvements! Fingers crossed!!!! If I get the interview! I’ll keep you updated if you care to see it! I don’t plan on stopping this fight. I was taught to stand up for what I believe in, even if I’m standing alone! I’m not standing alone! But I’m nervous to be interviewed lol!!! We will see it’s not set in stone yet!!! But I’m asking Senator Menendez to speak to adult vapers, and maybe understand a little why this just does not make any sense to us. It’s a witch hunt.  I will not stop fighting. Win or lose at least I know I did my part... and didn’t stop.
d5e6da*Haha*So do we know for sure that salt nic is safe ?
d5e6da*Haha*Seems like an easy plot for the cartels or cig companies to carry out. I wouldn't think that except for the media spotlight and coverage it recieves.

Clouds are one of the main reasons people dislike vapors.  If they weren’t visible, people would just say “huh, what smells good?” While looking around for the source."
aq6ljn*Flavour finds a way...*Yea well, that's just like, your opinion, man.

aq6ljn*Flavour finds a way...*"Honestly the flavor is what's most important to me.. but I recently rebuilt some of my MTL RTAs. I forgot how nice they were and how satisfying  a good MTL was. 

That said I was annoyed by the fact that there was barely any vapor xD. My one annyonace with my favorite RDA (profile RDA) is that the vapor is kinda mediocre compared to a dual coil..


A benefit is that it still has a good vapor production without fogging up my entire room..when I still used.mg dual coil RTA's I would end up with my entire room filled with a thick fog after a few puffs. I can chain vape the profile using 90vg liquid and it still won't fog up my room at all 

P.s. I ordered a wasp nano (clear one) from.aliexpress but forgot to change my address so now it's sending to my old fucking address.. 


They cost 20 Euro here while it's only 9 on Ali  

Anyway it's already shipped so i got fucked. I also ordered a half a dozen one shot concentrates, base, nic shots etc. I wanted to have the wasp to try them so bad because it's easy to rework and only single coil. 

So I ordered a a wasp.and while I was at it I ordered dinner lady lemon (always wanted to try that one) and another dinner lady.. 

Hate how expensive vaping is here. 20.euro for a 9 euro RDA and usually dinner lady is 20 Euro for 50ml.but this site had a sale so I got them both a bit cheaper..really excited to try dinner lady. 

Also hope the one shots I ordered are great..I ordered.my usual ADV and a new one I discovered there incredible. So I ordered a few more flavors from the same brand. But I have experience liking one flavor from a brand a lot and hating all other flavors :/.. 

Spend a fucking fortune again. But now I have juice to last me a month 3 maybe much longer if I like all the new flavors. "

People are scared of change, when the older generation see something like vaping they stigmatise it and since they are negative people in general they stereotype it and look for bad things in it. The world is backwards. I feel like our generation is the only hope left for the world.

dfa09p*BOO*Hey, I used to have that set up a few years ago
dfa09p*BOO*"Crazy how the narrative for years was ""will this vape explode on me?""... To ""VAPING KILLS YOU, DON'T YOU READ THE NEWS??!!"".

gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*Staring down at my leaky cloud beast and making eye contact with a vape juice stain on my sheets
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*That made me laugh
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*[deleted]
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*Smoks always been hit or miss w me. Some times I can just change a seal and it works... Other times it becomes batting practice...
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*Man i hate smok. Leaky shit
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*The one Smok tank I have has been fine, but I don't use Smok coils with it. If you have leak issues, try a compatible coil from a different manufacturer.
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*"my smok products never leaked 
bruh"
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*ahhh, i was all sad and shit that i bought a leaky tank, but seems i aint alone
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*I just threw out that exact tank a couple days ago haha. It was in a junk basket of old vape crap, along with my shitty Lyra
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*It's always the gasket getting warped that prevents an air tight seal.
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*"Yep.

This is why I hug my RDAs daily.

The rage I used to get from these and RTAs was something else."
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*That tank was one for the main reasons I only use rda/rta now.
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*I own a Smok Baby Beast V2 and it doesn't leak at all... But this meme made me almost shit my pants down 😂
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*Ok, but mine never leaked
gqa9ej*Reliable Tank*Old Smok tanks were horrible indeed. I'm talking TFV8 Baby days. Their current tanks are great though, haven't had a single problem with them. The mesh coils seem to last forever as well.
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*lets also not forget the hubba bubba liqour
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*I think they're targeting mothers there...
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*A suburban mom planned this
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*To be fair it is probably a good idea. Not restricting the vaping and sale of vape stuff which is idiotic, but restricting the advertisement and public displays. This won't affect us who vape, but would actually help with not drawing kids to it. But before that - something has to be done about cigarettes... this shit is everywhere. There's nothing that makes me more irritated than coming to a store and seeing large Marlboro sponsored advertisement stand... many countries still allow this shit.
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*But hang on a minute alcohol isn’t taking profits from tobacco companies.
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*VAPING BAD
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*Why do I feel as if this is in Arizona?
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*What am I expecting really , america would put a 17 year old in Iraq and give him a fricking gun but won’t give an 18 year old beer , they would be quick to point out that teen vaping is at a long time high but they don’t realize that smoking in general not just teen smoking is at a long time low , I’ve been noticing that the subject isn’t getting mentioned a lot so , i guess it’s better , tho am not an America so I really don’t know
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*"*funny comment*"
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*"Hmmm.....  I must be missing something, because I don't recall seeing the vape industry advertise to kids. What are they doing, running vape commercials during Saturday morning cartoons? Print ads in comic books?

Or is it more along the lines of, the mere existence of flavors that might appeal to kids is considered ""advertising to kids""?"
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*With box wine? Yea fuck kids get your wine someplace else???
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*That's baby crying medicine...
cq0zir*“We need to stop the vape industry from advertising to kids”*Away from the main point, are these prices cheap compared to the quality?

d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*It’s a good sign.  Must be the thousands of calls they get daily.  Including some by me.
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*"Please don’t get your hopes up guys. Let’s set proper expectations for ourselves. 

All I see was dude saying he was gonna nix flavors and now he wants to nix counterfeit somethings."
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*"This isn't even a good tweet.  It doesn't shoot down the flavored liquid ban.

It says ""keep young children from vaping"" and that's their whole motto on doing the ban.

 Imo I read this like this.

""I'm glad you all have found alternative ways to quit smoking, but we need to get counterfeit thc off the market, and ban flavors to make vaping less appealing for children.""

Imo this is like a ""I hear you, but fuck you"" tweet."
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*He got the info on lost votes. It's working folks. Don't let off the gas!
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*"Please don't take any tweet he puts out as anything close to reality or genuine information. Maybe it is, but we definitely shouldn't *trust* that it is.

No need to get into politics with whether you like him or not, but we should all be able to agree that the info he gives and positions he takes in tweets mean nothing."
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*Except he has a history of saying something and doing the opposite.
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*DONALD TRUMP TRIED VAPING CONFIRMED
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*Possible dumb question: if the problem is THC carts, would legalization and regulation solve the problem?
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*Lol I got banned from the Donald for threatening to not vote for Trump.
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*"No mention of criminally made THC cartridges, no definition of ""counterfeit"", and no acknowledging how well actual vape stores do at checking ID. This is street crime/gas station caused problem the media is generating hysteria about legitimate businesses and tested and tried products. The vape formula was patented in 1964, its solid. It didn't get widespread until battery technology caught up and the original patent expired because the guy who came up with it was a selfish bastard. 

I have been a die hard Trump supporter until two days ago and I'm not satisfied with this. Don't let your guard down and keep blowing up his Twitter and government phone lines guys."
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*What a fuckin day in age where we take the presidents Twitter account like gospel
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*I wasn't optimistic, but now I'm somewhat hopeful.
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*If this gives you hope. Even after ALL the times he's lied in the exact same ways well...then your the reason he was elected to begin with.
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*He’s a fucking idiot. Problem isn’t counterfeit flavored liquid nicotine products/eliquid. Problem is counterfeit black market THC carts. And what does he think will happen if he bans flavored illiquid? Exact thing that he’s talking about trying to prevent from happening. Counterfeit products/Black market bathtub eliquid. 🤦‍♂️
d3x5r0*Say what you will about the guy, but this tweet gives me hope*"So, I've been vaping approximately one month now. I just got sick yesterday.  It's a head cold. I probably got it from being around my young nieces, or maybe just by bad luck.  


Guess what literally everyone says when they hear me cough (due to post-nasal drip). Go on, guess."
ewfh5t*First things first*In the car, driving down the street...shit, turn back around, park like an a-hole, leave door open, run up the stairs, unlock the door, freak the cat out like I’m a bat outta hell, run back down, jump in car, good to go...
ewfh5t*First things first*Run back in the house, realize it's actually in your jacket pocket. run back out.
ewfh5t*First things first*"I once put one foot on the bus and realised I forgotten it, just looked at the driver and said ""shit sorry I gotta go"". Walk back to get my vape. Go back to wait for the next bus.......... Same driver!"

ewfh5t*First things first*Got halfway to work when I realised I didn't have it. Worst feeling imaginable. Didn't have time to go back either.
ewfh5t*First things first*Secret is to get 2 vapes and leave one in your car for just incase
ewfh5t*First things first*"I'm the opposite where I dont freak out when leaving it at home. It's just like ""oh well, I'll get back to it later"". Got nervous the first time, but it was surprisingly fine

Rewind a few years to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, I'd lose my shit if I left the smokes at home."
ewfh5t*First things first*Just like smokers. Always checked if i had cigarettes. Addiction stays addiction, even if it's less harmful.
ewfh5t*First things first*Me so bad! I’ll turn back around and drive back just to go grab it. I will NOT go to work without it!
ewfh5t*First things first*Me.
ewfh5t*First things first*That was me this morning.

Dude sent me a mech a box and a squonker, two rda two tanks, coils, cotton and ten bottles of juice*Had a house fire when I was in high school lost everything with nothing able to be salvaged throughout the house. Can smell treated wood being burned a mile away now. Losing everything regardless if its clothes electronics or ecigs takes a lot of time and money to rebuild. If one of my friends had to start over I would gladly buy them what they needed. Got a really cheap council of vapor royal hunter and the mini just in case my daily goes out. Can find them really cheap on certain sites. My advice is have a backup and have a bug out bag. As odd as it sounds a bag with clothes and essentials can go a long way whether it's a trip to the emergency room a random road trip.

dnlcg2*“I thought I could hit it like a juul bro”*Everytime a friend wants to hit it, gotta do a wick change
dnlcg2*“I thought I could hit it like a juul bro”*omfg I wish I could upvote it 50 times
dnlcg2*“I thought I could hit it like a juul bro”*I had a drunk dude in a part who would grab my vape and vape it real slow and proceed to cough his lungs out when the vapor came too concentrated despite me saying he should suck the air quicker. He did it like 20 times, I kid you not. The amount of juice he wasted that night was something to behold.
dnlcg2*“I thought I could hit it like a juul bro”*The best thing I did was to get a rta. If someone fucks my wicking I just change my cotton. Changing coilheads hurts my wallet
dnlcg2*“I thought I could hit it like a juul bro”*"I tried to get my buddy to understand that you have to suck it really really hard (because he was taking little baby back bitch hits and coughing) and now the opposite happened...

He puts his lips over the entire drip tip and half of the tank and hits his vape that I got him like he is inhaling the milky way galaxy because he thinks if he doesn't inhale like he's about to go in the deep end of the pool that he will cough his esophagus out. We tried explaining it to him but he just keeps smiling and nodding like he understands then does it again. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
dnlcg2*“I thought I could hit it like a juul bro”*"Due to 90% of people trying to ""smoke it like a cigarette"" after seeing me rip a whole lungs worth just before. I just say ""No it's unsanitary""
I don't want to have to rewick just because all the sudden you forgot how to breathe."
dnlcg2*“I thought I could hit it like a juul bro”*It depends on the tank. With the Valyrian (and a few holes poked into the cotton) I can hit it like that and it’ll last at least a month. Idk why but I find that sound satisfying.
dnlcg2*“I thought I could hit it like a juul bro”*when you vape drunk and wake up the next day with an empty tank
dnlcg2*“I thought I could hit it like a juul bro”*I have a falcon with the M1 coil and at 60 watts you can hit it soft, but not too soft or it’ll burn your mouth
dnlcg2*“I thought I could hit it like a juul bro”*"literally *anybody* when they hit my vape ha"
dnlcg2*“I thought I could hit it like a juul bro”*"God. I'm secretly pleased that I'm not the only person with this peeve.

9qok8u*Diacetyl notice!*I hate that Phillip Morris will use anything to spread propaganda against us. It’s so fucked up
9qok8u*Diacetyl notice!*"Honestly, this is the type of thing that's just as bad as the other side saying ecigs with diacetyl cause popcorn lung. 

There has not been enough studies done to determine if smoking causes popcorn lung. Basically, if you smoke and have lung issues it's put under the umbrella of COPD. Diacetyl in smoke could be causing popcorn lung, but the other effects of smoking like tar buildup are a greater immediate concern for doctors. 

There is also a difference in how the diacetyl is delivered. In smoking it is a particle of the smoke composition. In vaping it's carried to the lungs in the transport of pg/vg. There has not been enough studies to indicate if the diacetyl in vaping with a transport is different or less harmful than if a byproduct of combustion. 

""No concern"" should not be used.

Comparing to smoking is a decent first step if making this argument. But, it should be followed by the case of the popcorn factory workers. There were a lot of workers constantly exposed to diacetyl on a normal basis. It was in a different form (as a solid, compared to vapor or smoke byproduct). But, only the workers who put themselves at extreme risk (putting their head into a barrel of the popcorn flavoring, and deeply inhaling) for extended periods of time (years) were diagnosed with popcorn lung. The other workers who had much lower exposure did not have any complications.

Propaganda needs to stop on both sides. Just facts should be used, and opinions like ""no concern"" without studies to back it up are just harmful to any argument/discussion.

Key take away should be we need more scientifically sound studies done. 

If somebody says ""that shit is worse than smoking"" your only reply should be ""I **know** smoking **will** **kill** me, vaping seems less harmful because I can breathe better and feel better since switching""."

Many of my customers ask about popcorn lung and diacetyl.

I don’t doubt the validity of this post but is there a source for this information?

I would love to make some sort of informational poster like this for my store but want to be absolutely sure I am giving correct information."
9qok8u*Diacetyl notice!*I’m so tired of people saying vaping causes popcorn lung. It’s fucking 2018 and people still spout bullshit without doing any research whatsoever. Fuckers will believe whatever big tobacco and big pharma want them to believe 
9qok8u*Diacetyl notice!*I'm still not using juices with diacytal. Not taking my chances with it could be a difference with cigarettes being combustible and burned while juice being vaporizered, better be safe than sorry.
9qok8u*Diacetyl notice!*This is great! Before I started vaping I had done research on this because I had heard about it. After reading about the absurd amount in cigarettes and the minuscule amount in the “worst” e-juice I had no problem switching to vaping. On the first day I came to work almost every one started saying, “you’re going to get popcorn lung”, “how can you do that with all those fact about getting popcorn lung”, “don’t you know those thing blow up all the Tim?” And so on and so forth. Every time they would say these thing I would take out my phone and bring up one of the many articles that I bookmarked for just such an occasion and had them read it Most of them realized how wrong they are and stoped bringing it up, two of the guys that read it actually ended up switching to vaping because of me showing them the articles. It’s been 3 years now since I made the switch and I couldn’t be happier, I’ll never look back.
9qok8u*Diacetyl notice!*The amount of disgusting misleading propaganda out there against vaping is unsettling. And the media's way of using this misinformation just to get clickbait headlines is the worst culprit imaginable. As said above, SMOKERS at risk of countless problems and diseases are afraid to try vaping because of the bullshit scare of popcorn lung. Meanwhile they keep sucking away on guaranteed illnesses, some far greater than popcorn lung. That's powerful fear mongering. Hopefully we will see some reason and logic used when the FDA decides to bring down the hammer.
9qok8u*Diacetyl notice!*[Bronchioles](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj3xPvRjJ3eAhWM3lMKHQoGAuQQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fairways-and-air-sacs-of-the-lungs%2Fimg-20008294&psig=AOvVaw1b2VcE2Y9I_yWsOsRlKqCe&ust=1540402500786757) in the lungs get clogged up with like layers of tarry or just small gooey substances over so many prolonged periods of vaping. Think about it, you'll see what I mean without having to explain it. Cleanse your lungs as often as you can, take breaks and try not to chain-vape, or even chain-vape on a dirty set up. Just be hygienic and you wont experience any problems, and safe. Juice rich in potassium helps as a sort of homeopathic 'tonic' for your lungs. I use it every week, twice a week. Actually makes a difference for me but I wont be Gwyneth Paltrow and completely try and sell it. Everyone is different. Cranberry juice helps with infections, etc..etc.. ok im done being a paltrow.

This is our recycling bucket for mods that dont work anymore.*My trusted vape shop here in germany discontinued all SMOK products because of the numerous returns. It must be true that the mods are pretty shitty regarding quality and durability. But i have to admit that my TFV4 atomizer is almost indestructable and served me for more than 2 years without any issues and i still got that one in my collection. Is it possible that SMOK builds decent atomizers and shitty mods?

d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*Handling public health issues based on evidence would be a revolutionary act in the US.
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*"The UK health service is a government funded organisation, so they have a real vested interest in people's good health or it will cost them, unlike the private health in the US, which can stand to benefit from ill health. 

Therefore, this basically proves that vaping is always better than smoking."
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*I’ve been vaping for 6 years , started 13/09/2013 , smoked for good 22 years , always failed to quit using patches , Nic gums and medications multiple times , first day started vaping smoked 2 cigs and zero smokes since then , vaping helped me to quit cigs , saved me thousands of dollars , my health improved greatly ....iam a living proof that vaping far far better than smoking , still vaping and enjoy every bit of it
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*Wish all countries would be as thorough as this and not just follow blindly
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*It's the 1960's all over again in the US, ignoring solid science from reputable sources in the UK in favor of tobacco revenue. It's shameful really.
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*"'risk vaping home-made' liquids.. Been brewing my own for a few years now and I'd never go back to shop bought.


Edit: although I have just realised my comment is slightly missing the point. I live in the UK and live in fear that someone will impose one of any number of the vape bans that have been seen in other countries."
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*"Man its really hard to be a proud brit right now..

But this. This makes me proud to be british just a little bit"
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*I’m convinced it is all based on big tobacco profits and the tax that all forms of government receive. I would rather it be legal and taxed as high as cigarettes or less obviously is better.
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*"In my late teens I had quite a few friends who smoked. I was the first to turn 18, so for about 6 months I would always be buying my friends their pack of smokes.  

I had already smoked a few times when I was 11 & 12. One of my friends at that age wanted some cigarettes, cause apparently he stole a few from his dad once in awhile.  Anyhow this was back in the day 92'-'93 when cigarettes were displayed in racks in front of the cash register, so customers could just grab the brand they wanted instead of asking the cashier for them.  So I just pocketed a pack for my friend when I went up to buy a soda. And smoked a couple with him. 

Anyhow when I was 18 I got in the habit of charging my friends a tax of 1 or 2 smokes out of their pack for buying them cigarettes.  After about a month I was buying my own packs.  Ever since then I never successfully quitted smoking for longer than 3 days. I smoked between 1/4-2 packs a day for 20 years.  The majority of the time I smoked a little over a pack a day. 

I've been vaping since 2016, but I also still smoked.  Vaping did allow me to drop my pack a day habit down to 4-8 cigarettes a day the past 2 years and down to 2 cigarettes a day the last 2 months I smoked.   I finally kicked the habit for good in May this year.  Been completely tobacco free for almost 4 months now.  My blood pressure and resting heart rate has improved signifigantly.  

And best of all, I don't have to wash my face 10 times a day to get that cat piss smell out of my moustache.  

What did it for good was the flavors. I stopped shopping at my local vape shop because the juice is overpriced and they have a shitty selection of premium juice. That's why I kept buying cigarettes.  I wasn't getting enough of what i needed out of vaping, and what I needed was good flavors and variety.  So I started buying juice online for significantly cheaper prices. 

Also switching to rebuildables has helped tremendously.  I don't have to replace a coil every 2 days, and I get better flavor, consistently, and I'm saving a lot of money that's going towards juice and not shitty disposable coils."
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*If the FDA truly cared about our health they would be banning cigarettes from the market and only allowing the sale of E-Cigarettes.
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*"I wish but not here they just want to ban e-Liquid 
And keep cigarettes"
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*UK just earned my respect
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*Is there a website anyone can recommend to buy UK juice in the states?
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*I'm still wondering when the Free Market Conservatives are going to speak out about this.
d78cvm*This is how it should be done..*"Excellent, agree. 

As much as ""The Libertarian/Anarchist"" in many of us tend to be resistant to Government Regulations & Interference, 
I think, to protect the ""Vaping World"" as a whole, that we accept that this has become necessary at this time. 

The eCig/Vape Juices industry needs to be willing to agree upon safe devices and products made for inhalation quality standards, much like the Public Health Departments do for the food industry, and Lobby to create the minimal manufacturing standards that will pass rigorous FDA criteria.

Yes, many small, individual, ""Mom & Pop"" juice, Nic Salts & CBD inhalent products made in their humble home based businesses may not be able to pass 
federal requirements, and lose their income stream. 

But, unfortunately, I'd rather have the Vaping industry regulated than have to continue to defend it in the face of this current US Presidential hysteria."

ee7jk5*Anyone else like doing this?*That and lasers never get boring lmao.
ee7jk5*Anyone else like doing this?*One time I was on acid with my friend and he set up one of those laser things that project patterns onto the ceiling. I could not stop blowing vapor into the laser thing because it shows all of the individual beams of light going up to the ceiling. Mucho fun times. Kind of a similar effect to the picture, kind of an unrelated random thing that this picture reminded me of.

ee7jk5*Anyone else like doing this?*Paulaner beste
ee7jk5*Anyone else like doing this?*I am still waiting to use this trick to save someone’s life when they are sitting there and a red dot from a laser site from a gun pinpoints on the person. Blow the cloud at the light to see exactly where the laser (gun) is located.     Die a hero.    I always kind of imagined this move in some cheesy action movie.

dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*Meanwhile in VA, U.S.: I was up at my local hospital the other day because the pharmacy I go to is directly across from it. Doctors, nurses, around 10 of them... All standing at the pharmacy smoking because they couldn't smoke on hospital grounds. Not a soul vaping, because you'd be shocked at the amount of people in the health care field here who will tell you to smoke rather than vape. My OBGYN actually told me to start smoking again.
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*UK has it figured out. Props.
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*Wish they’d implement this at the hospitals in my city. Hate having to go with all the smokers and getting weird looks.
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*"This is where I feel so lucky to have the NHS behind us. 
Think about it, it’s a free service for us brits, so anyway at all they can not have the hospitals filled with people suffering smoking related illnesses, the better it is for all involved. (Saves stretching resources, staff, equipment, etc, not to mention the financial strain on the NHS for such treatments) 

Not American, but the way I understand it is, if you need any healthcare, you pay for it. So yes, it seems to me the US government, health authority etc, actively wants as many people to seek healthcare, to make money. Aswell as tax on cigarettes.. 

It’s disgusting. 

I genuinely feel for all you Americans going through this absolute bollocks about vaping being banned.."
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*We need to adopt the term “electronic vaping” here in the US. It shouldn’t be so commonly referred to as an “e-cigarette” when there are virtually zero similarities.
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*Based uk
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*We have no vaping signs up people still vape in the no vape zone it’s great
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*i love that there’s a distinction made here. really pisses me off when people think vaping is the same or worse than smoking like cmon guys it takes ONE google search.
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*I don’t vape, but I am glad to see this. Rather have someone vaping around me then smelling a stinky cigarette.
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*Rare logic that canada doesnt have
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*That’s good they stopped Bothering people here to i had a few issues with cops
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*Cool. I'm near Cville
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*The green vaping sign still looks too much like an e-cigarette...
dgwuea*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*I was going to comment and say, I know this isn’t shithole America, then I read the title that says UK. Maybe one day our country will be as great as the ones around us. I’ll probably be moved to a better country by then, but still.

e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*"I always see a lot of people do this but what is the use behind it. I mean a mod is just to transfer power from batteries to tank so it can heat up a coil and vaporize the liquid so why would you have like 25 mods ?

I could understand if you got like 1 ''normal'' box mod, 1 pod system , 1 squonk mod but more then 1 of each I never saw the point.

Same with RDA's, a buddy has like 27, I bought a Drop in early 2018 and still got it and use it 24/7, it gives good flavour, easy to build, good airflow. I asked him what do you do with the 26 other ones and he didn't really had any reply.

I mean where I live e-liquid premade is already expensive enough for what it is, let alone if I go collecting 35 mods and RDA's."
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*Then we get into high end game. And get served divorce papers.
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*"Can confirm. I buy two of every mod I get. 2 of any rda or rta I really like 

I want to buy 2 cold steel 100s wvwb5hough I already have two of them.  But boe they sell them without the fugly logo and I need a backup for every color, right? 

Also I wanted the new profile rda colors eventhough I already have 3 and lately use one of them max. And now I've seen the profile 1.5 which I have to get. And I still don't have the unity which I should get, but the last time I decided to get the unity I ended up ordering two lotus RTAs and a kayfun lite 2019 (clone). 


I stopped buying mods and shit for a while. I need to wait a year at least so new RDAS release which are a substantial upgrade. Although the profile rda 1.5 is.very tempting also.i really need the unity. If I buy new mods I will buy more ehpro cold steel 100s lol. I just.hope by the time I buy new ones they don't increase the price to 60 euro or some retarded shit (they are dirt cheap, like 25 euro a piece on aliexpress)


^(EDIT: this made me look up the price of the ehpro thinking they might be much cheaper due to cyber Monday/black Friday. The prices are the same, supposedly discounted from 60 eventhough all these stores sold it for 25 ... if you're from Russia it's like 10 euro, how do they even make profit on this shit. **anyway I found out they have two new colors, bronze and copper** ... and i wan et :/)"
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*"Haha. I can relate so much. 

I'm up to over 60 personal mods with another 50 or 60 in boxes. 

I'm up to over 110 personal decks and another 50 or 60 in boxes.

I bought a vape shop out. Lol.

At first I went into hoard mode..then I learned to build by practicing on all of them and buying older, harder to build decks. Most were built once or twice and have sat. That's really true for most of my shit.

After I got my kayfun, I slowed down a bit. 

Then I started buying kayfuns....

It's just like gotta have gotta have gotta have when I see shit. Or at least it was.

I've stepped down my buying a bit...but I still do. 

But building everyday helps with stress and my mental state so theres no cap on money for that.

But if you wanna find a good endgame or starting point....grab a kayfun and a DNA. All your other shit will sit and you'll buy less cheap shit...


. But you'll buy more expensive shit, so really it's however big your house and wallet are."
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*Seems like we are always chasing something else! With the cigarettes you chose your brand and stuck with it. With vaping there are so many options and we keep chasing something new to keep it interesting. I am as guilty as anyone. Whatever keeps us off the smokes eh!
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*"I don't know about you guys but...

Once I realized I was done with a 30+ year pack and a half a day smoking habit after I just TRIED vaping because a friend was into it...

I decided I could spend as much on vaping as I was previously spending on smoking...  and ended up with a TON of stuff.

Now I have enough mods and tanks and commercial juice to last me for a year...  and enough DIY supplies to last me for pretty much a lifetime.

Haven't really been spending a whole lot lately..."
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*I've never owned more than one vape at a time.  I like my Uwell Nunchaku.  Are they really so different or is it a collection thing?  (I've never been the collector type.). Just curious!
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*"Laugh, this is a great post. I am guilty of having way more than I could ever use, but I also know exactly why:

1) I like shiny things. I figured I was saving a small fortune not smoking, might as well buy the quality choices for vaping.

2) I like the hobby aspect of it, so I have mostly rebuildables and associated raw supplies. I like to tinker and I like variety.

3) I have always been prepped for the highly possible vapocalypse. So I have lots of high performance mech mods to effectively last a lifetime."
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*I got my vaping down to a minimum. I got my first mod and tank for free. Then I bought an aegis legend and crown 4 last year on sale. I buy mystery juice bundle which is 120mlx3 for 28 bucks. And a 4 pack of coils for $15. That lasts me the month. Hella money saved compared to my 2 cartons every 2 weeks.
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*"Honestly my biggest cost has been finding a juice I like.

I like fruit flavors and have no interest in dessert or nutty flavors (tried a couple, not for me) but I've found most to be too sweet for all day vaping. Then you have issues like a certain juice burning out the cotton/coil way to fast. Ran into this with the newish fruit monster line. Juice tastes great. Have to change the coil every couple  days or so while another juice will last the more typical couple weeks or so. Also fruit monster as good as it tastes is to sweet. 

In any case I've been trying honeydew and watermelon types lately as there generally a more subtle sweetness and I've been having better luck. Still haven't found the winner but I'm close now. I think honeydew and watermelon are where it's at for me just need to find the right one."
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*For me, I find the industry is evolving so quickly, and the money I save from smoking, I keep upgrading.
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*"Just ordered a Pulse X and a Podstick.

I'm feeling it now, Mr Krabs."
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*Do I spend too much on vaping?  Yep. Do I care? Not really.
e4ku8s*I just can't stop - copied*This is literally what I did when I first started vaping. Switched to a pod system so now I’m saving $$$

He used to smoke around minimum 50 cigarettes a day. Later he started vaping and he quit smoking. Now he has also quit vaping....no one speaks about it. With the help of vaping he quit smoking and even vaping. I can’t understand why the mass media or even anyone doesn’t cover this nor anyone ever speaks about it.

hsxldy*I hit mine every time*"I got really fucking pissed when the media misconstrued and edited this ones guy on the news to make it look like his whole sickness was affected by regular vapes, when it was actually black market THC cartridges the guy ended up doing an interview on dash vapes turns out he's never even used a regular vape 

There's nothing wrong with THC vapes aslong as they are made in a registered factory with ingredients that are actually supposed to be used."

hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*Yuuuup! I can still smell the RY4 juice that leaked out in my pocket when I was super hungover. Terrible, terrible flavor i cant get close to anymore.
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*"Me.

Ego-C + CE4.

8 years ago."
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*Yes! Why do I miss it for some reason?
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*"Ahhhh cartomizers. The good ole days. Before those I started on these super early Chinese imports. 

They had a very thick nicotine paste in what looked like cigarette filters. The atomizer was screwed onto the battery and was comprised of metal fibers. 

THOSE were the early days, man. Shit tasted like ass and barely had any nicotine. I can still remember the taste.

Edit: https://vapingdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-History-of-Vaping-200x-1.png

These fuckers. But the part that went into the cartridge was way more crude."
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*I had something like that for about half a day and it wasn't enough so I ended up back on the cigs for a while. Then sub ohm tanks and vv/vw box mods were everywhere and they suited me much better.
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*My very 1st attempt at harm reduction was the heated cigarette called Eclipse. It had a carbon tip that heated the tobacco. 2nd attempt was the old cigalikes where you injected juice into the filter section. My 3rd and finally attempt was with the original ego pens of which I bored of quickly. Thanks goodness mechs started coming out shortly after the egos
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*Nah, my first vaping experience was from the vapes that look identical to a cigarette, claiming that It had 200 puffs but it was only like 50
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*Kangertech Evod 1.6 ohm coils I believe on 12-18 mg nic 7 years ago.
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*I did. It was a Kanger Evod.
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*I didn't start off with the Ego C,  but I certainly used them...
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*That’s what I started with bout 5 years ago
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*Yup it was an eGo-T.  A bit rubbish but it did its job at the time.
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*"Haha, yep. Think I may still have several in a box somewhere. Total garbage, but still a step up from the awful Chinese cigalikes that cost me a small fortune in 2007.

Then on to eVods, Evic/Protank, mech/RDAs, then RTAs and box mods. Good times. 😀"
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*These are pretty much just used for THC/CBD vaping now, right?
hvi2ro*Who else started off vaping on one of these ?*Sure did!
dcjrw7*This is huge*this is the correct way to regulate the industry im glad to see some states actually taking this seriously
dcjrw7*This is huge*This is really great news!!!!    First step in the right direction in this cluster phuck!    Am I remembering correctly that Utah has laws against online ordering?   If they could fix that as well....
dcjrw7*This is huge*Completely agree with Utah in this situation. Convenience stores target kids, not flavors.
dcjrw7*This is huge*Totally agree, as a manager of a reputable vape shop, we card EVERYONE minus obvious senior citizens. Every vape shop I’ve seen did the same. Gas stations used to sell me cigs when I was 8. Bro.
dcjrw7*This is huge*"Sharing this article about who is selling and what is being sold to minors, for those who didn't see it: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaping/comments/d6ozww/please_take_a_moment_to_read_this_entire_article/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Utah gets it and is implementing proper, appropriate legislation. Such great news."
dcjrw7*This is huge*I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WOU... oh. That actually makes sense.
dcjrw7*This is huge*"THIS !!!! This is the correct way to handle vaping.

&#x200B;

Thank GODDDDD. We may finally be moving in the right direction."
dcjrw7*This is huge*THIS is what I was looking for from lawmakers. Utah is just one state, but its a step forward. Its smart legislation that actually attempts to address underage vaping without limiting adults from purchasing e-liquid. From experience, gas stations don't card very well, and vape shop employees are more likely to know how to spot fake IDs as well. I've never been to a vape shop that hasn't carded me, and a few have even stopped me at the door to ask for ID. I don't look all that young either. This is a great development. Other states, take note.
dcjrw7*This is huge*That’s one of the best ways to regulate the industry. I’ve never been in a vape shop that didn’t card me.
dcjrw7*This is huge*Is Paul Ray still trying to outright ban vaping products in Utah? Hopefully it’s a dead issue at this time.
dcjrw7*This is huge*This is fantastic and the way it should be. In Ohio our shit governor wants to ban flavors next. We’re begging customers to call him and let him know why that’s a bad idea.
dcjrw7*This is huge*Good! Support local vape shops anyways! The tobacco outlets already sell tobacco, alcohol, and “water pipes” to make their money. They don’t need to cut into the vape industry too because when I need vape gear I need an experienced person behind the counter, not some average gas station attendant.
dcjrw7*This is huge*Whether they're banned or not, one thing's for sure: that business will continue to sell cigarettes. I disagree with any legislation limiting access to ecigs. Not everyone that legitimately wants to quit tobacco gives a shit about vaping. But they might give it a try if it's on the shelf next to the cigs at the store they already go to
dcjrw7*This is huge*This is how it should be
dcjrw7*This is huge*"Now that's a smart move. I hope the states which have already banned vape will think about that and let people buy safe juice in vape shops too, instead of a stupid and dangerous ban. And I hope vape shops, everywhere, will play fair for everyone to be safe. It's very important that they are responsible, so vape can become something everyone could trust.

I'd like to help you American vapers to stop the ban. Is there anyway for me, in EU, to help ?"
anrsaa*The thought of every vaper when we see a smoke machine*My stage lightning teacher allows me to vape when the smoke machine is on since the smoke detectors have to be turned off anyway during usage. Awesome guy!
anrsaa*The thought of every vaper when we see a smoke machine*Can confirm. Our church doesn’t have a smoke machine so I just rip fat clouds during my sermon.
anrsaa*The thought of every vaper when we see a smoke machine*My friends from the photography club use me as a smoke machine during photoshoots. Started buying 0 nic because, my head would be spinning for hours after.
anrsaa*The thought of every vaper when we see a smoke machine*What is this from? I remember watching it but I can’t remember the name
anrsaa*The thought of every vaper when we see a smoke machine*This is so relatable lmao 
anrsaa*The thought of every vaper when we see a smoke machine*"Back in the day, you could use inside everywhere and the airplane policy was clear: vape in the bathroom, reason: to not scare/annoy other passengers, later on they banned vaping in lavatory which was where they told you to go vape. 2015-2016 things went south fast. 
Now it’s a mess per country. At least where I live they divided smoking and placed vaping as LAST RESORT nrt. But that’s because we have universal healthcare and cancer costs everyone."
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*Hands down one of my favorite mods of all time. For the longest time I thought my X Cube Ultra II was amazing but boi was I wrong.
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*"*Slaps roof of mod*"
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*The crossover. Spaghetti vape.
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*I’m going to be the black sheep here, but as someone who owns a Drag I don’t get the hype. Sure, it’s a good mod, and sure, it hits hard, but it’s so heavy and clunky, there is always overhang, and the button rattle is terrible. On top of that, it’s so overhyped and popularized that it seems like everyone owns one. I much prefer my Pulse 80W, whose only downside is the limited battery life, which is understandable with it being a single battery mod.
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*"Bought one for myself, then was told not to come home without one for my husband. Easily have sold more VooPoo Drags than any other mod of its caliber. 

( I say it that way because salt nic mods sell way too well here. )"
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*God, I wish it was Voodoo instead of Voopoo
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*I’ve had mine since they first released and it still works like it did day one. The only issue I’ve had is the magnets fell out of the battery door so I had to superglue them back in place. 
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*Sometimes i'm sad i quit vaping. I really enjoyed the hobby that it is. But being addicted to nothing also has it's benefits. Rebounding to cigs too often i decided to go cold turkey on nic and everything relating
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*Except when the screen dies like mine. Garbage. 
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*Give me the Paranormal or the Basium any day. 
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*Hell yes. My Drag is a beast and has been put through a lot but still delivered. Matched up with a Crown III I haven’t had any wanting to upgrade or try anything else. 
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*I own one and I love it.
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*So I must say, I joined the hype and I could not be more disappointed. My drag lasted me a grand total of 3 months before the fire button became jammed and would continuously fire when batteries were in it, the cheap paint peeled and chipped almost completely off during that time revealing an unattractive and almost grainy looking metal, forcing me to go back to my old Smok Alien mod that’s been going strong for almost a year now, not to mention my pro color which has been dropped about 1600 times with minimal chips, and the paint still intact, I will never buy another voopoo product again.
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*Heyyyy that's one one I have (except mind is gold  with red and green)!
9keym7*Being a Drag Owner Myself*"Three greatest mods of all time:
1. Limitless box mod
2. Sigelei 150 watt box
3. POOPOO DREG"
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*Should also get all the alcohol companies that have fruity flavors to take notice too. It’s crappy that they aren’t helping support our cause. They could be next.
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*People already are quitting vaping and starting smoking. It’s sad
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*I have been waiting to need to contact them. I have been trying to keep track of any news of vape flavor bans in my state...but I haven't heard of anything. The most recent thing related to teens I heard about on the local news is that Colorado schools at least 500 are going to try adding esports as a school activity like sports...but nothing on banning flavors to stop teens vaping.
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*"Vaping isn't even what's killing these people. It's the knockoff THC cartridges with the hodgepodge of bs chemicals they're filled with. Every new article chastising vaping has one small sentence eluding to the THC carts being the cause. Gotta love their scare tactics and all the mice that scurry to fit it into their agendas. And all the sick kids you hear saying ""mom it must have been from the Juul I was using 😢!"" Of course they're not gonna tell em about the illegal THC carts they were buying from Billy."
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*Fuck I shouldve invested in wakky tobaccy
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*"Not really, Marlboro's producer Altria Group has $12.8B invested in Juul.

I get your point though"
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*You people.  You're too focused on the persuasion of the media,  focus instead on the fact that in this point in time vaping is still 95% SAFER!
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*[deleted]
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*Sucks man, it’s fucked how the system is just focused on money over in the states and there’s very little care for people’s health and well-being. It’s stoptober in the uk next month where the NHS are promoting vaping and encouraging people to switch even more than before in the light of all the heat in the media surrounding the industry and a majority of vape shops are putting on deals on essentially all products as well as liquids while tobacco prices are rising massively. Makes me thankful to be in a vape friendly company. F to the fallen flavours
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*But the company that owns Marlboro owns Juul
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*on a unrelated note have you guys heard about this new joker movie and how they are saying maybe don't release it cause kids will go crazy. apparently the army i think issued some warning that it'll cause people to go crazy or something and on the news they actually mentioned something to the effect of maybe they should not release it. craziness.
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*"https://www.facebook.com/vaporhausdayton/videos/241924293394965/
This is my local vape shops informative video. Like it share it. They also make JuiceHead and have paid $500,000 per flavor per nic level to be fda compliant but none of that will matter if Ohio gets a ban."
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*Alcohol has always been against the Cannabis industry spending millions lobbying congress to keep cannabis illegal. Could Big tobacco and Alcohol companies be behind this mass poisoning event? Just fodder for thought....
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*Mm I’m pretty sure Cuomo came out with it like 2 days after Whitmer. I’ve been following this since day 1
daailk*Seriously contact your state legislators*It's not about vaping , it's all about tax money. The government is losing billions in cigarette tax and the tobacco companies are stopping the kick backs to all the parties. So election season is around the corner and wham, a shot ton of bans and regulations.

ibj3on*FlAvOrEd VaPeJuIcE iS aImEd aT ChIlDrEn this beer is fine though*Atleast I can buy ice cream filled with alcohol in NY now. But over 500ml of flavored eliquid is illegal. And its all illegal to purchase also. Lmao. This shit is ass backwards. I refuse to obey an unjust law, and will continue to supply and help anyone i can with vape gear.
ibj3on*FlAvOrEd VaPeJuIcE iS aImEd aT ChIlDrEn this beer is fine though*This has pissed me off my whole life.

ibj3on*FlAvOrEd VaPeJuIcE iS aImEd aT ChIlDrEn this beer is fine though*Imagine meth and heroin addicts seeing ads with groups of people having fun together shooting up and smoking foil... this is how I feel being bombarded by alcohol ads on TV, on the radio, on social media, constantly a main topic of discussion at work. I've gotten over it (mostly) but as someone who's life was almost destroyed by alcohol (and my own choices obviously) I wish our society would realize how dangerous and unhealthy it is.
ibj3on*FlAvOrEd VaPeJuIcE iS aImEd aT ChIlDrEn this beer is fine though*That and all the shitty flavored vodka and rum, every underage kid I know drinks fucking whipped cream vodka, or pineapple rum, if not that then all the sweet flavored whiteclaws or monocos.

Also totally agree that’s bullshit."
ibj3on*FlAvOrEd VaPeJuIcE iS aImEd aT ChIlDrEn this beer is fine though*All the anti vape laws are just about money, the anti vaping crowd just uses kids as an exuse. If there wasn't tax on cigarettes governments wouldn't give a shit about vaping. Or if they actually cared about health.
ibj3on*FlAvOrEd VaPeJuIcE iS aImEd aT ChIlDrEn this beer is fine though*Yup.............................. Drives me insane.
ibj3on*FlAvOrEd VaPeJuIcE iS aImEd aT ChIlDrEn this beer is fine though*"While we all love these things, but it's important to take a stand against them and speak up to your reps about it until vaping flavor bans are off the table.  Fuck alcohol companies

So many of them basically just hit the ""Reblog"" button on what looks like a Big Tobacco press release. The term ""vaping illnesses"" that seems to be the official media term for ""death by illegal THC cartridges sold by drug dealers"" is laughably false. That's like rolling a blunt, lacing it with crack, calling the resulting heart attacks ""cigar smoking illnesses"" and then banning flavored cigars and cigar wraps.

I was listening to NPR today and they straight up said that ""US health officials"" say that the deaths are all ""associated with vaping"". Didn't even mention black market THC cartridges *once*. And even those same health officials they are talking about admitted these deaths seem to be entirely caused by illegal THC cartidges. At least NYT and WaPo bury that fact in the last few paragraphs: NPR didn't even mention it. That is blatantly false reporting. And that misleading reporting is how Trump and Cuomo and others are getting away with banning vaping.

It's absolutely disgusting."

So now all the flavors they carry are 0 nic and you buy the unflavored nic seperately to mix in yourslef. The kicker is that previous laws taxed E juice by the ML regardless of potency. What you used to pay was tax on the whole 100ML bottle, now the only tax the county gets is off of the 5ML or so of pure nic. Even if ""vape juice"" gets banned, whats to stop people from selling flavored PG VG blends as ""auroma therapy oil"" or ""incence"" or under any other name as long as it has a ""not for human consumption"" label... rant over..."

Sometimes I can not wait for our generation to grow up and for the old politicians in office to pass away.*"It isn’t *really* coming out of nowhere, unfortunately. Some party or another has wanted to do something about vaping for at least 6 years now, and definitely further back but vaping was so fringe it basically didn’t even register. Now that there are more teens vaping, cigarette revenues are down, and the industry is fairly unregulated, they’ve just taken the time to strike while they can. 

It is extremely unfortunate and definitely more swift than I would have ever expected but this is something I’m sure many of us expected."
d6y7xk*Crazy how this kinda came out of nowhere. Such a shame that the government is absolutely FUCKING terrible. Sometimes I can not wait for our generation to grow up and for the old politicians in office to pass away.*What's ridiculous is that they're trying to ban things as if it's a health concern...

They obviously don't with cigarettes or alcohol and crappy health insurance structure.

I visited my favorite vape shop today and they had all ejuice 50% off. I asked the lady and she said that they are taking a vote in two months on whether to ban it or not. So the shop owner is getting rid of all the ejuice he can in case the vote goes through and he has to throw all of his ejuice in the trash.

&#x200B;

She said they could still sell regular cigarettes, glass, and cigarette making equipment. But with just those sales the shop would be closed for good because vaping is 80% of their income."

dpa0kw*I made a JUUL costume for Halloween*since you’re a vape, does this mean you’re banned from trick or treating in certain states now? lmao
dpa0kw*I made a JUUL costume for Halloween*But are you vaping a JUUL? No cheating now!
dpa0kw*I made a JUUL costume for Halloween*"That's one of the scariest costumes I've ever seen!!! It should terrify everyone in this forum! Juul is the main reason for all of these vape bans so I can't stand Juul!, 
I would hope every single person in this forum would agree with me, but I'm sure there are some who have yet to see the big picture, and also some who simply don't care. 
Now I realize some people's knowledge of vaping starts and stops with ""using a Juul keeps me from smoking"", and that's alright though I wish they'd educate themselves . But there are many who know about Juul and especially what Juul has done since Big Tobacco took the reigns, but they continue to buy and use Juul products anyway. I will never understand why anyone with knowledge of Juul would continue to give money to Juul!
My view on it is this-  If you support Juul in any way then you support Big Tobacco, therefore you support a complete ban on all vaping products(whether you've realized yet or not)...

*Sorry for the rant, but Juul absolutely infuriates me!"
dpa0kw*I made a JUUL costume for Halloween*You should totally put on a grim reaper cape over that thing and carry a scythe!! LOL
afar2h*Smokers when they learn that Marlboro wants to focus on electronic cigarettes vs. tobacco products.*It's not to be more responsible, they don't give a fuck about people they care about money. Once they saw the profit potential and the market share companies like JUUL have now their eyes turned to dollar signs as they started drooling.
afar2h*Smokers when they learn that Marlboro wants to focus on electronic cigarettes vs. tobacco products.*"On the bright side, since tobacco lobbyists are the main reason that the FDA has been cracking down so heavily on vaping, having a tobacco giant like Marlboro decide to hop on the vape train might actually help prevent the FDA from doing stupid shit like banning flavors. The FDA claims thay want to ban flavors because ""candy and fruity flavors market to children"" but they know damn well that adults like those flavors too, they just want that juicy tobacco lobbyist money."
afar2h*Smokers when they learn that Marlboro wants to focus on electronic cigarettes vs. tobacco products.*Do you guys think that in the future vaping will completely replace smoking? 
afar2h*Smokers when they learn that Marlboro wants to focus on electronic cigarettes vs. tobacco products.*I’m not sure how I feel about big tobacco laying in bed with the vaping industry especially JUUL since they’re the ones who get blamed in most cases with underage vaping. I personally think this is just so they can profit off of people vaping rather than supporting a switch from their products. 
afar2h*Smokers when they learn that Marlboro wants to focus on electronic cigarettes vs. tobacco products.*Who the fuck says that vaping is worse than smoking?
afar2h*Smokers when they learn that Marlboro wants to focus on electronic cigarettes vs. tobacco products.*"It's not big tobacco that is our worst enemy. It's the pharmaceutical industry. They are losing billions if smokers switch to vaping. Smoking related diseases are their biggest business. Unfortunately big pharma is BF of the FDA, the WHO and the public health groups. And they have the money to back up their case. The tobacco industry doesn't care that much. They also have money. So they just take over some vaping companies and stores and keep doing what they do best. Making profit. The pharmaceutical industry is the looser. That's why they will fight us with every weapon they can get into their hands. Without moral, integrity, honesty or responsibility. Think about it. A whole industry is built on smokers smoking (and getting sick and die). Their very existence is at risk. All the people who work for organizations and programs like ""tobacco free..."", ""tobacco harm... "", ""stop smoking"" - how are they going to pay their rent without smokers? They need smokers being unable to quit. They need some underage kids to become the next generation heavy smokers addicted to tobacco. It's their job. It's their income. It's their life. They are at war with vaping. And they will do everything to kill it. "

afar2h*Smokers when they learn that Marlboro wants to focus on electronic cigarettes vs. tobacco products.*My only reservations about vaping were people picking it up just cause with nicotine juices and then shitting on me for smoking. I have since moved on from that.
afar2h*Smokers when they learn that Marlboro wants to focus on electronic cigarettes vs. tobacco products.*Idc if it's just for profits, I'm glad it's finally happening. People will adjust, they'll buy the capes for their big fix and,be better off.

86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*I love going to McDonalds and seeing a stack of 50 napkins in the bag, I know i’m set for days. 
86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*Love drying my tanks with these after a good bubble bath 🛀 they don’t leave any fibres 🙌
86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*Although expensive, there’s nothing like blue shop towels. 
86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*My work has reclaimed cotten rags, basically old shirts that they bleach all the color out of and sterilise them before cutting them up for use as cloths. I grab a couple every week and swap them out just for cleaning leaks and spills.
86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*Microfiber cloths are the best option I've found, absolutely nothing compares to how easily they can be reused. 
86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*[Paper towels?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYkjLUMx19I)

86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*I used to use napkins... A damp hand towel is 100% the way to go. Cleans up the juice so much better. 
86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*These just smear the juice around in my experience. But it's generally what I keep in the car soo..
86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*?
86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*Am I the only one who hates these? They leave fibers everywhere and seem to just spread the juice all around.
86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*I found a better tank, hardly leaks on me. Also, invest in some handkerchiefs, paper towels always annoy me because they usually let off all these little particles. 
86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*Tissues for minor leaks/dripping, paper towels for heavy leaking, and those tiny microfiber cloths for polishing.
86od48*2 Years Into Vaping And I've Found My True Best Friend*I relate to this on a spiritual level

atylg6*When someone hates on someone else’s hand check.*Is this about the smok thing earlier? 😂
atylg6*When someone hates on someone else’s hand check.*"I get the whole Smok thing, but I have to say I agree with “everyone has to start somewhere”. 

My first device was a Novo by Smok. It worked. It got me off cigarettes. Since then I have smoked other Smok devices and I can tell they are not that great. That is why I’m graduating to a Dani mini box with a kayfun tank (made in Germany).  But, if it hadn’t been for the little novo I never would have had an interest in vaping. They are mass produced and made in China, but it’s a learning tool.   We’re all evolving our tastes as we go. "
atylg6*When someone hates on someone else’s hand check.*"I started with a Blu pen, then an Aegis Legend, then came the Topside Dual and an Orion, and this week I ordered a Pulse Dual and an Ohm Boy Rage.

We all gotta start somewhere.

I can say I like this group a lot more than some other Vaping subs"
atylg6*When someone hates on someone else’s hand check.*I just bought my first legit device and didn't do a hand check because of that
atylg6*When someone hates on someone else’s hand check.*“Why can’t weeee beee frienndddsss, why can’t weeee beee friendddssss.”
atylg6*When someone hates on someone else’s hand check.*I have a smok procolor and proud of it. Ive had no issue with it whatsoever. 
atylg6*When someone hates on someone else’s hand check.*"Ive been all over the spectrum with mods and right now using a smok, I'm running the e-priv right now and I'm happy with it. I've noticed that it's a hit or miss on a lot of the prince coils but haven't had any issues otherwise.

Not everyone wants to drop 200 bucks on a mod I have the money to but choose to keep my mod purchases in the $100 range. My car is enough of a money pit as it is don't need to have a collection of 20 mods to validate myself 😂"
atylg6*When someone hates on someone else’s hand check.*"THE SMOK REVOLUTION HAS COME

atylg6*When someone hates on someone else’s hand check.*Much needed. Thank you, good person on the Internet. 
atylg6*When someone hates on someone else’s hand check.*It’s just an expression.  The term being a “hater” I thought that was a given.  This post isn’t directed towards you and I’m not defending smok.  I’m picking a bone with people who claim to “just want to educate” people about products but really they just want to self glorify their set ups.  It’s just some middle school ego trip type stuff I don’t believe has a place within our community.   I hope that helps clear the air here.

**let's see how different vendors describe mystique's hyperion juice!**

> The valiant warrior. Hyperion is a tobacco based flavor. The complexity of these liquids makes them hard to give an exact description.

ok, so far we know it's tobacco based & difficult to describe, possibly infused with the essence of valiant warriors 

> To categorize this savory flavor as simply being ""tobacco based"" would be akin to calling the Louvre an art house. Much like the many treasures that adorn those Parisian walls, what you discern from Hyperion will depend on the experiences in life that have crafted the most peerless of masterpieces...You. 

tobacco based with a splash of old canvas; hopefully you didn't have a bad childhood, that's going to affect the flavor  

> Tobacco.  No description exists that can define what you will take from this complex, inimitable experience. Your interpretation of this indulgent symphony will be yours, and yours alone.

If you think about it, it's not only cigarette tax revenue that's at stake for governments.
Big pharma stands to lose a lot on nicotine patches, gum, cancer medication, etc...
Insurance companies also take a hit on health/life insurance policies
Hospitals lose revenue when less people fall sick.
And don't forget the corporate taxes from companies in each of these industries go down with their revenues"
ecqg1j*Denmark the new (WANNA BE AMERICA)*"I just read a article that said, and I'm paraphrasing, ""we are concerned that more young people will start vaping because it tastes sweet, and the youth will eventually switch to real tobacco from vaping"". 

If the concerns is young people getting into smoking form vaping, what good is it to restrict the flavour to... Only cigarette flavours...

The government is actually a bunch of brainlets."
ecqg1j*Denmark the new (WANNA BE AMERICA)*That is so dumb. Come on Denmark, you’re smarter than that.
ecqg1j*Denmark the new (WANNA BE AMERICA)*Im so confused by the title, could you please explain?

ecqg1j*Denmark the new (WANNA BE AMERICA)*"Portugal already adopted some pretty stupid rules already...
-You can't buy anything vape related that's outside of Portugal, even though Portugal is included in Europe... that's like you living in New York but you can't buy from Washington DC...great.
-You're strictly prohibited from buying anything associated with nicotine online, even if it is inside of Portugal like stated above.
-All the prices of nicoshots skyrocketed...
-And vape shops cannot sell any base with nicotine.
And rumor has it that it's only gonna get worse here, there's already talk of outright banning Vapes.

Man I miss 2017..."
ecqg1j*Denmark the new (WANNA BE AMERICA)*We never did get a lot of the vape bans in the US. It was just a bunch of water-muddying to take attention off of that weeks presidential scandal. I’m in California and we did nothing and we are usually the first state to pass legislation about public health concerns. I’m glad we didn’t, where California goes the country follows. The outcome could have been much worse.
ecqg1j*Denmark the new (WANNA BE AMERICA)*Dank

dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*Crazy that people’s livelihoods are being severely affected by this scare mongering. It’s criminal.
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*Wow this is crazy ! How many people died from smoking dirt sticks getting lung cancer over the last year,but a couple idiots smoking motor oil get sick that’s it it’s all over . Wtf I feel sorry for state .
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*"Tainted THC carts, made with Vitamin E oil, and other oils that become toxic when heated to a high temperature are the problem.

 I don't think putting the blame on all THC carts equally is good either. This works with e-juice, and THC/CBD carts, legitimately made products, with quality ingredients are not harmful to people's health. Which is why banning e-juice, and keeping weed federally illegal is only going to make things worse. Because, like weed, it's only gonna create a blackmarket that's full of shitty, tainted juices."
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*https://imgur.com/a/BafkqZT our great MA governor!
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*Yes, a lot of shops are closing. And the ones that are still open are struggling. This is about money and the greed of Big Tobacco and Big Pharma. How do you BAN a substance in the US, and for such a weak reason at that? Hard time to getting guns banned. Alcohol and caffeine products are still in stores. They’d rather have people turn to cigarettes and then get sick because they want to go back to money flowing into their pockets in folds. They keep people down by pressuring them to choose the alternative of what is clearly a good choice like they’re doing with clean energy. This is a generational war on progress and it’s an imposition on the rights of the people. They began bullying shops when they slapped tobacco tax on vaping products to keep shops from prospering and making it more expensive on customers. Then they hiked up prices to 100k for each new flavor, denying them their autonomy and progress. These are intimidation tactics and ways to hold down small businesses on the verge of a rise. There’s no logic behind these acts. They’re creating rules and laws as how it befits them. And this THC crap is their Trojan horse in. Cigarettes are horrible, and inhumane, yet, they’re still on the shelf in stores. The only problem is that they’re collecting dust. Going after and Banning vaping in the states like this is some dictatorship country, makes it crystal clear what this is really about.

dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*All the bullshit scaremongering has got that bad in the US here in the UK health officials are coming out to deny all what’s being said over there.
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*Drove past vapor station in Woburn and they are closed fown with a for lease sign in the window. Sad as fuck, they were so good people.
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*"Ever since they banned flavors in WA, alot of the gas stations have huge banners outside that say ""cheap cigarettes."" Just read an article of a 26 year old that was hospitalized for 8 days due to vaping and they made sure to add that she said ""people are better off smoking then vaping"". Smh....yet she said she quit smoking and started vaping when she found out she was prego...lol"
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*Yesterday on my route I noticed one of the shops I got a caliburn from about a month ago closed :(
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*Dude this is the shop in Auburn ma right? I used to stay in Auburn alot and go there it's in a mini plaza
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*"It's so ridiculous that the media claims to be ""fair & balanced"" & ""facts first"". If this were an issue caused by vaping nicotine, then why are these deaths only happening in America and not in any of the other countries across the world that use the same devices and ejuice formulations as American vapers?  And why now- when millions have been safely vaping for a decade? This is an orchestrated media smear campaign funded by big tobacco who seized on the fear mongering of the media as soon as the hospitalizations and deaths started occurring as a result of counterfeit thc vape cartridges. Big tobacco has been waiting for something like this, they couldn't have had a better situation fall into their laps."
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*whatalad
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*Welcome to the club. Went to go get some 3% mint Juul pods last night bc I heard there was still some but I didn’t think there was. Anyways, long story short is it‘a only tobacco flavor and I’m outta pods. But I do have an old pen with nearly a full bottle of some tasty 3mg blueberry shit
dh67hc*At my local vape shop in Ma*It’s not thc carts it illegal black market thc carts if you get a cart from a dispensary it’s perfectly fine and won’t kill you
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*My first customer of the day was a regular. He’s been vaping for about as long as I have, which is well over five years. He should know better. And yet, these were the 18650 cells he was using inside his device. After a stern lecture, I sold him a fresh pair of cells at the cheapest I could. Please PLEASE practice diligent and thorough battery safety guys. It’s so important to treat these cells with the care they deserve. Our industry is in such a precarious state at all times that any one person who hurts themselves through negligence hurts us all.
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*Please tell me that the left one was not being used currently in a mod.
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*that left one looks like it already exploded.
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*Wow that hg2 is seconds from disaster..
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*I guess I just dont understand how batteries can get this beat up in the first place. I've only been vaping a year but haven't had so much as a nick in my wraps
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*Hey, at least they are not Efest batterys 😆
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*Sweet jesus that's horrifying. Well done looking out for people.
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*Ok how the fuck did that mod not catch on fire
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*Could you just re wrap them?
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*"I cant imagine looking at that battery on the left and thinking ""this is all good, I dont need to replace it."""
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*"Thankfully there are people like you. I went into a half vape/half head shop the other day. I told the lady working there that I needed some battery wraps... she looked at me like I had three heads. 

**She works at a shop that sells mods and literally didn't know what a battery wrap is!!!**

I was fuming when I walked out. How are customers supposed to be educated on proper safety if the employees don't even know anything about the products they sell!?"
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*Ooohhh....I hope you gave him/her a lesson on battery safety. Not worth thinking about what might have happened here!
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*I always preach to my friends that vape to take care of their mods tanks and batteries. Last thing they need to be is another statistic in some news article.
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*Had a customer come in with a battery a bit worse; around 75% of the wrap was missing. He went to put it into a VGOD tube his friend gave him. I have never snached something away from someone that fast. He asked what the problem was. Gave him one of our battery safety guides. He decided to buy a regulated box and leave the mech here lol
cx1b08*Started My Day By Confiscating These From A Customer*"How does anyone look at the left one, even outside of the context of vaping, and think that's not gonna explode / start a fire / fuck up whatever they're gonna put it in.  


Like there's being lax on battery safety, and then there's just being blind."
90wbir*Well If you can’t laugh at yourself.*I had this one guy at work harassing me about vaping. Then he got picked up from work by his mom. I had the last laugh

90wbir*Well If you can’t laugh at yourself.*"Real talk though. My ex girlfriend would shit all over vaping even though she had a juul. She said I was addicted to it and she didn’t like that. Well at least it stopped me from getting into cigs and cut my 6+ cigars a week habit completely.

av52iq*A few people warned me...*Fucking true. Except my mod collection is a little bigger than 4
av52iq*A few people warned me...*I think I did it backwards. Bought the mods the atties and rda’s.  Enjoyed it but still smoked daily.  Then got a pod system and boom!, no stinkies in 2 months.
av52iq*A few people warned me...*To be fair I’m sure there would be significantly less hobbyist types out there if today’s pod systems and nic salts were on the market when I started vaping 6 years ago.
av52iq*A few people warned me...*"Accurate! 

I just wanted to stop smoking with a neat little pocket sized pen that tasted like strawberry. 

Now I use mechs, spend too many hours fiddling with wire and cotton and book tickets to vape expo’s. 

I thought this was meant to be cheaper than smoking?"
av52iq*A few people warned me...*Unfortunately no one warned me, none of my friends vape but I had to quit smoking bc of new apartment rules. I was doing okay on blu, awful juice but at least getting my nic fix. Then decided to branch out...
av52iq*A few people warned me...*Accurate except for the 3 sets of batteries part. Each mod should have two sets of batteries, so that you don't risk a mod being out of commission! Skipped right over that essential detail (shrug)

eld9gl*I never learn*My sneakers have a hidden pocket in the back of them that I keep a juul in just for reasons like this lol
eld9gl*I never learn*Live dangerously like me and only have one set of batteries.
eld9gl*I never learn*I know your pain.....
eld9gl*I never learn*happened once.. stocked up on cells and chargers now i would have to forget charging for 2 weeks lol
eld9gl*I never learn*That is me today, but I forgot to swap batteries before leaving for work. Two more hours then I can go home to new batteries.
eld9gl*I never learn*10 mods in rotation 😂never a flat battery
eld9gl*I never learn*Happened once, now I have 3 sets.
eld9gl*I never learn*looks down at my mod...oh crap
eld9gl*I never learn*what really sucks is when you only have a salt nic and you forget to charge it before bed
eld9gl*I never learn*Slightly unrelated, but Holy shit, buying my batteries off of Liion recently, I've realized that I have been buying bullshit fake batteries. These batteries last at least twice as long!
eld9gl*I never learn*"when you read the FDA is making fruit flavored pods illegal in February and NOW EVERY WHERE YOU GOTTA BE 21 to vape

...fuck is right"
eld9gl*I never learn*Happened at work, I was very irritated that day lol
eld9gl*I never learn*I’m in that situation right now . Fuck!
eld9gl*I never learn*This show is so fucking good. I wish the next season would come out faster lol
eld9gl*I never learn*Right now instead of that, I have a coil that burned out in less than a week somehow, with juice that I don’t like with not enough nicotine because I couldn’t get to the vape store. I hate my vape right now lol I’m going to the store after work
d9pu6c*Yo dude you got that mango (OC)*"Vaping is a wire, a battery, some cotton, and a fluid with nicotine in it that might have flavoring.

If we can find safe juice, there's nothing anyone can do to stop vaping.

Making mech mods isn't hard.

What we'll have is a bunch of kids using dangerous unregulated homemade mods with black market juice.

A situation farrrrr  worse than what's happening now.

If the bans hit everything in two years the headline will be:

""36th homemade mech mod explodes in kids face this week, this makes the 16th death""

What are they going to do? Ban lithium batteries and types of metal used for coils?

Not to mention we have 3d printers and aluminum milling machines now."
d9pu6c*Yo dude you got that mango (OC)*just remember UK guys, you can still get big tanks in germany and france
d9pu6c*Yo dude you got that mango (OC)*Little tip for the vapebros in the UK, order a Dreadnought RTA by vaperz cloud, it has 2ml capacity with the RTA build deck but you can ditch that and it fits Falcon King coils, which will bump up the capacity to 10mls. It also looks better than pretty much every sub tank on the market and the airflow is much quieter as well.
d9pu6c*Yo dude you got that mango (OC)* Concerntrate?
d9pu6c*Yo dude you got that mango (OC)*Nailed it!!!!
d9pu6c*Yo dude you got that mango (OC)*You've come a long way baby.
d9pu6c*Yo dude you got that mango (OC)*2 liter tanks for former chain smokers?
d9pu6c*Yo dude you got that mango (OC)*I really feel bad for what's happening over the pond.
d9pu6c*Yo dude you got that mango (OC)*Or just put juice on some foil and heat with a lighter haha
d9pu6c*Yo dude you got that mango (OC)*Why not just buy a squonker? Like the dovpo topside... Holds 10mls

You can get them in loads of places though. Like Iceland a budget but generally pretty good frozen food specialist has ejuice just hanging out at the end of aisles.

duapn7*Spotted in a UK supermarket. At least we're getting something right!*Interesting. Do you know anything about regulations on e cigs/vaping in the UK?  If they're sold in the healthcare aisle and I've read hospitals, they've got to be better tested and regulated than US. I'd love to see this in stores. Also, since it's approved for smoking cessation there, are doctors trained in how to use them and how to get off the vapes?

buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*Didnt take long for confused coffee dad to become a meme.
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*Im gonna go against the grain and say never had a leak in the smok tank, but my freemax mesh pro tank leaked once, mainly because it has no locking mechanism.
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*"I’ve had so many friends who are just getting into vaping come up to me and ask why their smok vape isn’t working. not even a minute later i find and fix the problem. 

Absolutely hate smok products"
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*never had this happen and ive only had smok
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*"And the tanks that don't leak have coils that last 6 hours before turning to shit.

Which sucks cause for that 6 hours, massive flavor and vapor production.

Any suggestions for similar airflow tanks that hit hard, don't leak. TIA."
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*Owned several smok tanks, at least past 4 years. Never had this happen nor seen it happen
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*hahahAhehEhAHEhAHAhAahaA DAe smOk bAD?
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*"Solution : Stay the F away from Smok tanks !! 

And yes every Smok tank I have ever owned has been just like that."
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*I've already left my tank out in my car on a hot day. JUICE EVERYWHERE.
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*To prevent leaks just fill with airholes close,turn upside down when done with refill,open airholes wait 10sec. And you are good to go....it took mi year to quit doing after switching to Rba
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*Ok so basically smok bad
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*It really do be like that.
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*"Yeah their tanks are pretty bad. The big baby beast tank is the worst horribly made in everyway. The V12 prince tank is alot better. If you build good with the RBA it's actually not to bad. 
But I don't see why you would buy a smok RTA. Unless you like their pre-buildt expensive coils"
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*"I'm running an iStick Pico 75w with a Smok Baby Beast and the Vaporesso GT Mesh coils, and it's a massive upgrade from the Melo 3 Mini.

Coils are long lasting, give off loads of taste and flavour, but they really do chug juice. 

A brand new 50ml lasted me through last weekend, but I was vaping often, and at 75w, so that's why, but the  tank itself is great."
buqjtd*It be like that sometimes*Bought a RBA to my X-Baby last week, always leaking, needed to make the setup 5 times to make it work. Bought a Dead Rabbit yesterday, first mount and it was ready, no leaks, no dry hits

Hell I ended up with covid and ditched a full pod, eliquid and coil because I didn't want to risk a reinfection."
r81zti*Please tell me I'm not the only one infuriated by this.*Well, guess it's time to replace that coil.
r81zti*Please tell me I'm not the only one infuriated by this.*"Or they inhale SLOW AS FUCK and then wonder why it's so harsh and thick and cough up a lung.

My gf does this with my mod every single time no matter how many times I walk her through that it's kinda reverse logic where hitting it faster makes it much smoother.

Same with MFs who use my dab rig lol.

The only time to hit it slow af is dab pens"
r81zti*Please tell me I'm not the only one infuriated by this.*Last bloody night at a work party, someone insisted on using mine saying they use them all the time. Proceeded to suck without pressing the button, told them you need to press the button, then they stood there for 10 whole fucking seconds with the button held just looking at it. Nearly died inside
r81zti*Please tell me I'm not the only one infuriated by this.*"I vape on a mech and when people ask me if they can hit my vape, I tell them ""sure, let me drip it real quick!"" And the proceed to drip 50mg salt onto the RDA. They usually don't ask again after that lol"
r81zti*Please tell me I'm not the only one infuriated by this.*Who let's else hit their vape anyways? That's weird and gross as hell.
r81zti*Please tell me I'm not the only one infuriated by this.*I cannot believe how many people offer to share their vapes. People I barely know. I am not a germaphobe and I will share a blunt, vape or whatever, but it still astounds me how open people are to sharing it. I will not offer to share mine though.

9oyo8q*Can’t wait till I turn pink*"Well hey. Vices are vices, you have a friend or family member drives drunk constantly. 
Judge people in your own circle.
 If you find you lack the reslove to tell a loved one they're wrong and they need to stop, that means you support it or stay neutral... 

And as for your fear mongering. Grow a pair and stick tonyour values. Stalking smack will inevitebly get you smacked, I bet you would never be so brave face to face with a vaper.

You can hate it all you want, you still know NOTHING anyone else doesn't.

Spend your valuable time, that you will never get back speaking ill about something you KNOW is terrible, like drunk driving.

How much of a police state do you really think you want? Is seeing people exercising freedom you have okay with you?

"
9oyo8q*Can’t wait till I turn pink*When I switched over to vaping, I have heard it all. From people who say that smoking has less chemicals in them to other people talking about the popcorn lung stories. Its a daily struggle but at least I do not smell like a dumpster fire anymore. (And if i choose to buy some tobbaco flavours because I have a cig crave, then I know I can at least smell like a classy turkish dumpster fire.)
9oyo8q*Can’t wait till I turn pink*I think any other argument would be better than this. He could’ve said popcorn lung ya know the usual, but he decided to go with “they will turn pink”

bk5v2n*I felt the need to make this*Haven't had spitting or dry hits in ages. Last true dry hit I remember was just after newyears, had my goon ready to re-wick, coils were cleaned and glowed, top cap was off. I wasn't paying attention and reading something on my computer screen, grabbed my vape to hit it, and was met with 110 watts of clapton coils to my lips. It burnt and blistered the shit out of them. THAT was one burnt fucking hit.
bk5v2n*I felt the need to make this*Wait what's spitback
bk5v2n*I felt the need to make this*MaDe WiTh MeMaTiC
bk5v2n*I felt the need to make this*I had a coil in my vape for so long (about a year) and it actually just went back to not tasting burned ever. I didnt know you were supposed to change the coils. I still regret throwing that coil away thoigh it was fully brown when I did.

These campaigns piss me the fuck off because they rely on shady data and sensationalism to get their point across. If they were honest and had more appropriate adds that weren’t so fucking stupid maybe it wouldn’t be so annoying.

5r1ydm*Let's talk about vaping.*"You sir are a saint...or as the youngsters say ""you da real MVP"""
5r1ydm*Let's talk about vaping.*"Something I've been trying to find out which I haven't been able to very clearly is what is the driving force behind the rhetoric for e-cigarettes- good or bad. In my experience with these kind of issues, if you follow the money, 9 times out of 10 the side in the wrong is the one with the most Financial backing.  

For example, a big one that comes up is http://stillblowingsmoke.org. They go hard after big tobacco, give similar arguments to the ones addressed in this post, and a bunch of other ""think of the children"" shit. How hard they go after Big Tobacco is concerning for me. For a long time I disregarded negative ads for Vaping because I assumed it was funded by big tobacco. This site claims every big tobacco company owns at least 1 Vape company. I wanted to dig into this sites motives for doing this.  
The site unfortunately appears to be funded by the CTCP (California Tobacco Control Program); a tax payer funded institution for fighting tobacco industries operating under the California department of Public Health. Seems very legit and even has a page detailing [Every Project they fund](https://otis.catcp.org/public/projectDirectory/index.cfm).  

I could keep going with these examples but they are mostly similar and would start to feel redundant. I haven't been able to find any shady ties to anti-vaping groups and to be honest, weakened my own opinion in the process. I've kind of made peace with what appears to be uncharted territory. The truth is that it's too early to see what the long term affects of Vaping are. In a sense we are Guinea pigs being tested for future generations- pioneers if you prefer.  
I think we need to stop trying to rationalize vaping. It's feels good, but it's certainly a vice. I don't see value in making dissertations between the harms of Vaping, smoking, drinking, eating fast food etc. The best thing to do is just assume that it's bad for you, then make a judgement call for continuing use according to how much you like it or frankly, care about health repurcussions.  

Tl;DR- If you follow funding, it would appear that ""the good guys"" are pushing for anti-vape legislation. Do what you want with that info.   "
5r1ydm*Let's talk about vaping.*Bottom line is, if you're a smoker...vaping appears to be honest, weakened my own opinion in the vicinity.
5r1ydm*Let's talk about vaping.*"These are all super old and debunked theories and everyone knows they're stupid.  There are some actual scary questions that they really have no data or answers for.  The biggest for me being: what are the effects of inhaling super heated metal over long periods of time, as coils deteriorate am I inhaling flakes of metal into my lungs?  

It's not the juice that worries me, it's really nothing, it's coils and atomizers that worry me.  "

$87 on juice all month every month!"
ccpkrb*Shut up and take my money*Ha ha! Get the good juice and you don't need high end exotics with 3 sets of batteries and 4 tanks... If....
ccpkrb*Shut up and take my money*I'm pretty much the opposite.. I make my own juice and it saves me so much. Prob spend less than $8 a month for both my bf and I to vape. Can't justify spending even $10 on 30ml of juice when I can spend the same amount on concentrates that will make 500ml worth of juice.
ccpkrb*Shut up and take my money*I'm the opposite. Just bought a new  $100 mod but hate buying juice
ccpkrb*Shut up and take my money*For me it's the other way around, need to spend less on hardware and more on finding juices I really like.
ccpkrb*Shut up and take my money*You can vape for very little cash and I don´t want to see vaping becoming as expensive as tobacco smoking
ccpkrb*Shut up and take my money*I hate spending big money on juice while I am using something like the Freemax mesh pro or Profile Unity because you can burn through 60ml in under a week.   however using small stuff like the caliburn I dont really care what the juice tastes like because 30ml will last me a week and a half.

aqmwns*It be like that*Man I came here to quit smoking, not for a hobby that involves more hours than a part time job. Leave me the fuck alone.
aqmwns*It be like that*Pod guy here :)
aqmwns*It be like that*I switched to RDAs about a year ago, and recently just tried a sub tank for the first time since then; I was pretty impressed at how much better they are. The flavor still isn’t on par with RDAs in my opinion, but much better than before. I could understand why newer vapors don’t switch. 
aqmwns*It be like that*Doesnt matter what your vaping on, as long as your not on those god dang stinkies!
aqmwns*It be like that*"*squonks*"
aqmwns*It be like that*Rta over rda :p
aqmwns*It be like that*I proudly vape from my SubOhm. I just havent learned enough to start on the other types of coils or have the time right now.
aqmwns*It be like that*"Tanks all the way here.
Hands have no dexterity to them anymore. 

Hard enought for me to replace coil heads as it is."
aqmwns*It be like that*I’ll take my Freemax mesh pro over RDA
aqmwns*It be like that*Always better 👌🏻
aqmwns*It be like that*RDA master race lol
aqmwns*It be like that*"**HONEST QUESTION HERE!**

What are the advantages of an RDA over a sub-ohm, tank user? I ask because im heading towards the end of life on this shit DRAG that i bought about a year ago. It was working fine but has since started to not fire when pressing the button (a common issue i hear) and im looking to possibly step into the next stage of vaping. 

Is it the flavor?

The build?

The sheer geekyness of it? Akin to someone who buys prebuilt computers vs building your own? (Sorry im in IT and the only thing i can correlate it to)

Thanks!!"
aqmwns*It be like that*I'm off the subohms too.  Love my rda with the squonk.  Once a week maintenance.  Coils last a LONG time with good cleaning.   Taste is amazing.   Though I've also just gotten me a pod too.  For the super hard cravings, and stealthy vape.  Combo works great.   
aqmwns*It be like that*Just saying I never have to buy coils and it takes me less than 5 minutes for a simple build and wick.
aqmwns*It be like that*Great thread by the way. Its cool to see both sides of the coin....I'll just say this I loved vaping with my freemax tank...when I switched to RDA it changed my life in the fact that it was such a drastic change in flavor that I fell down the rabbit hole and now I have an expensive hobby. I collect RDA's and love the subtle differences each atty brings out in the same juice...for instance the Wasp is a warm dense wet vape where as the Drop gives a smooth cool and slightly dryer vape and brings out different notes of the same juice...tldr I love vaping 😁

m53mou*Anyone else?*"That feeling when all your limbs go *static tv noise*"
m53mou*Anyone else?*Ik the feeling is great im just worried about cause canada might do a federal ban of over 20mg nicotine cap and i might not be able to vape 50mg salt nic if the ban pass unless if i’ll be lucky enough to find a site that would still sell&ship to canada☹️
m53mou*Anyone else?*I vape freebase but the first hit of the day always tastes the best.
m53mou*Anyone else?*Idk man, first thing in the morning for some reason I can vape up a storm. Midday I can take a hit or two and get unintentionally domed.
m53mou*Anyone else?*Vape less
m53mou*Anyone else?*Space out your nicotine use. Use it only during breaks at work, or just once an hour max if you don't work
m53mou*Anyone else?*Very true, I don’t use salts only did for about a month but when I did, the morning hit used to bring me to my knees
m53mou*Anyone else?*I can't vape in the morning before my first spin cone or otherwise the cone isnt as good without that fresh nicotine
m53mou*Anyone else?*The first time my brother hit my 50 he literally blacked out and fell off the bed he was sitting on right onto the floor. He came to within a second or two but he immediately just blacked out lmfao
m53mou*Anyone else?*Wow nicotine junkies do exist
m53mou*Anyone else?*You all sound like a bunch of teenagers. Makes me wonder.
m53mou*Anyone else?*The first vape hit of the morning is my favorite part of vaping. I get light headed and it feels like the first time I ever hit a vape all over again.
m53mou*Anyone else?*"I know it's tough because nicotine is hard to quit, but if you vape a lot less you can get this feeling every time you hit it.

Another thing you can try if you like the physical action of vaping is to get an extra 0mg juice and once you get the nice buzz you're looking for swap to the 0 nic juice instead."
m53mou*Anyone else?*Dead ASS! I'm using 3mg mixed in with a little bit of 6 both salts and I swear it does nothing for me during the day but when I'm not doing anything or I guess idle, it hits me smoother than a perfect bull's-eye

95czpf*Lol*"JUUL users lost most of my respect after they started using ""JUULing"" as a verb. "
95czpf*Lol*"Don't shit on the manga if you've only watched the anime. 

That's how the joke goes right? "
95czpf*Lol*i see a lot of people shitting on juul users and being very smug about it. people like what they like and as long as they're not pricks about it, who cares? i still don't juul tho cause that's gay.
95czpf*Lol*"Juul helped me quit cigs. 10yr smoker. nothing else worked. Virginia tobacco. All the other juices have weird chemical fragrances that fuck up my throat and gave me headaches.

Funny shit but it probably is helping a lot of old timers quit and live longer"
95czpf*Lol*[deleted]
95czpf*Lol*"Recently bought a juul after using mechs, box mods and squonker for years, really like how discreet it is and no clouds so easily vaped in crowded areas

Max 20mg nic salts in the UK though :("
95czpf*Lol*Juuls are the Apple of the vaping industry, simple to use, but very overpriced and dont really stand out when it comes to features.
95czpf*Lol*I never had a real vape but love my juul so far
95czpf*Lol*Juuls, the cigarette butts of the vaping community. Hate those things. I see the empty carts discarded everywhere. 
95czpf*Lol*My biggest concern is the nic salt. People are switching to really high levels to get high from it. It seems counterproductive to what vaping is to a lot of us. A way to free ourselves from cigarettes. 
95czpf*Lol*Quality meme
95czpf*Lol*can you refill juuls?
95czpf*Lol*"I’m still pretty new to vaping.  I’ve had devices on and off through the years but a couple weeks ago the wife and myself decided it was time to buckle down and get off cigs.  We went and got two devices, mine a sub ohm box mod and hers a smok stik, and haven’t had a cig since. 

However, she soon found out even hers being a pen style it isn’t easily concealable and then she had major issues with it constantly leaking.  Almost to the point she was about to quit and buy a pack of cigs because of all the issues.  And then for me, I’ve not had any issues with the device itself but more issues related to carrying a dual battery sub ohm around at work and then when riding our side by side, the tank almost got cracked

Enter the Juul.  I actually had never heard of them, nor did I know anything about this Juuling craze amongst teens(Vaping isn’t actually the most popular thing here yet, kids here still think it’s cool to smoke).  I picked up two Juuls for each of us, a pack of cool cucumber for my wife and fruit medley for me.  After the horrible experience of that flavor, I’ve since switched to mango and really enjoy it.  I’ve watched countless videos of other pod systems and the Juul just works for me.  

Being a smoker for all those years, I want something that cures the cravings but is still simple and easy to manage.  I do like the Switcher mod but I haven’t even used it since getting the Juul.  I don’t want a bunch of bottles of ejuice sitting around and I don’t want to be any kind of hobbyist of vaping.  I want something that works, keeps me from smoking, and is very convenient and for me the Juul hits all those marks."
95czpf*Lol*i have multiple mods and a couple juuls. the both have huge advantages and disadvantages. the juul is more discrete, really easy to use and it hits pretty hard. pods are really expensive but the mint and cucumber flavors are pretty refreshing. my girlfriend really likes her juul. we’ve been abroad in europe for the summer and even with my vape we both mention how we miss mint juul pods. we tried a sourin air at the start of the summer but it stopped working about 2 weeks in. they’re definitely more cost effective options to juuling but it is really easy and the juuls themselves have a really good warranty. 
95czpf*Lol*Dank.

en2dnp*Please*Imagine a guy going in there, it smells great, the man pulls out an RDA, set to 300W, drowns it in ROOT and fills the whole room with it. That's a way to ruin it
en2dnp*Please*Yes! I support vaping lounges in airports. Maybe it was Utah airport, but went to vape in their smoking room and there were probably 40 people jammed into this little space. The cloud was so thick you could tell they didn’t even have an decent air output fan and it smelled so god awful. I took two puffs and had to get outta there. I did not get the nic fix I needed, but I thought I was going to vomit. Defiantly helped reinforce that switching to vaping for my nicotine was one of the best choices I’ve ever made.
en2dnp*Please*All the regular smoking rooms smell so terrible since I switched. I went in Atlanta I believe and even though the smoke is sucked out of the vents, the butts everywhere leave a stench.
en2dnp*Please*"I flew to Amsterdam a few years ago and their airport had this high tech room just for smokers. It was pretty litty.

Automatic sensor doors and before they would open a vacuum above the door would engage and sound like a turbine until they shut. The walls were full glass panels and exhaust fans were pumping the whole time. I thought it was neat"
en2dnp*Please*Windex should be lobbying for this intensely.
en2dnp*Please*It's called the family bathrooms. So long as no one seems to be waiting

atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*This sub used to be all over smok. Everyone forget they had the alien? It was just about the only thing that got posted for a while
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*[deleted]
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*Fuck that gatekeeping shit. Would I personally buy smok? No. But if it keeps you of cigs I don't give a shit what you use. 
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*But the 1000 drag handchecks are ok 
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*Aren’t their two pod systems reliable though?  The Novo and the Nord?  I don’t have either, but I’ve heard good things.
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*My first piece was a smok and it's held up pretty well. I still use it occasionally. Personally I've not had any negative experiences with smok. I even got my wife a speices and she loves it. That's just me tho
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*Gatekeeping vapes now? 
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*Better than a hand check with a pack of cigs.   Whatever works for you is all that really matters.
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*Is a vape brand, this is a vape sub. Let's not be snobs. I'm not going to be a snob, anyway. 
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*"Smok makes a lot of stuff. It’s flashy and inexpensive. It’s often what catches a new persons eyes when they walk into a shop. So it’s popular. I’ve personally had nothing but bad luck with the brand. I tried several tanks and two mods. The mods were garbage. One (Alien) just decided to start firing on its own. It would just keep heating until I removed the batteries. All the tanks from the baby beast up to the beast king or prince or whatever they called it, were leaky and coils didn’t last. 

I think Smok gets a bad rep for two reasons. One, because others have had similar bad experiences. Two, because anytime something gets popular, it’s trendy to dislike it. "
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*Oof people don’t like smok? I started vaping cuz my parents got smoks and that’s all I’ve really ever had 
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*"I've been vaping the smok species mod for a good long while now, my valaryian sits pretty right on top of it.
"
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*What I have come to realize with Smok is that the very first batch of a new product they put out are absolutely fantastic, but the more they make of the device the cheaper they make them. Ive worked in a vape shop for about 2 and a half years and I’ve seen many of their products come in and the issues they’ve had. I personally had that experience around August of last year. I bought a Novo the first day we got them in and that thing was absolutely amazing, I used that device exclusively for about 4 months. About a month or so after I bought my first one, I bought a second as a backup. It was the same color, and the second one didn’t hit the same, when you looked inside where the pod makes connection was different, they overall didn’t function the same, AND the thing that gets me the most was that there was a noticeable weight difference! The second one was so much lighter! In the time frame we’ve had them, not long after I noticed these details about my second one, the people that purchased them around the same time and after have had the same issues I have. Their quality control is straight up garbage, ESPECIALLY on their coils! You pretty much have a 50/50 shot of getting a good or a bad coil, but I will commend them on the mesh coils. They majority of them last an average coil lifespan. Out of the Smok I’ve encountered the only ones I personally recommend are the x-cube, alien, t-priv, baby/big baby with strictly mesh coils, the prince tank strictly with mesh coils, and the baby v2 tank. Smok was amazing back in the day, but unfortunately they have gone to caring about mass producing rather than the quality of the item they’re making and that makes me sad.
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*I'd rather see someone posting a handcheck of their first Smok and telling us how much time since their last cigarette than see another handcheck of some $5000 squonker made out of moon rocks or some shit.  
atvdox*When someone posts a smok handcheck*I lot of us newer vapers started on Smok hardware, can't really hate. My first vape was a Smok Stick with a baby beast, had zero problems until I upgraded

Which means that you won’t be able to “purchase” flavoured liquids anywhere in the State of New York,but what if you travel out of State to purchase liquids and carry with you proof of purchase of out of State liquids and continue to vape flavoured liquids in New York - that’s allowed or not allowed? 
I find the whole situation totally bewildering at times,I’ve got it in my head that you could be arrested for vaping flavours on the Streets of New York and be deemed a Criminal for doing so .. 
somebody care to put me straight on the can’s and cant’s?"
d7yi2k*Living in New York right now...*"I used to live in NY about 2 months ago, shit sucks. I was gonna go back for alitlle bit but.... Nope not worth it now.

What about online sales? Can you still get flavored juices shipped into NY from an online seller?"
d7yi2k*Living in New York right now...*You really think that beat cops give a fuck or is this just satire 😂
d6axh7*Vape shops in hospitals in the UK.*"In the UK we get free health care via the NHS. So its in our government's and health services interest to promote safer options than smoking. 
More smokers means more health issues and more strain on NHS resources and cost of running NHS. 
Now as I understand in America you have to pay for all your health care and health insurance so of course if you are healthy and not smoking then the government and health associations are not making as much money.
And neither are the tobacco companies.
Now I wonder how long it will take the average American to realise that it is in big pharma and shareholders in pharma and tobacco to keep you from being healthy. And unhealthy american is money in their pockets after all."

d6axh7*Vape shops in hospitals in the UK.*"Remember the days when the USA promoted smoking cigarettes and told everyone that it was safe which was totally crazy and a blatant lie. 
Now those same people are saying vaping is dangerous and smoking cigarettes is better for you 😂 now if people can't see this is another blatant lie then they need to wake up."

Plug in air fresheners put out chemicals that can be dangerous to cats. Of course, drinking water in some parts of the US can be dangerous to cats and people. The soil is contaminated from centuries of pollution. In many places the air will get worse if EPA regulations are decreased. Fuck me now. I'm ordering a bubble to live in from Amazon. Chemicals in the bubble will likely be harmful to health. We're all gonna die, just like every single mofo ever born on this planet. Have you talked to your cat about premarital sex?

ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*the wife calls it alchemy
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*Other way round for me
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*Can you make Nic salts yourself? If so how?
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*Juice ban?
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*If there are any shops still open they can sell unflavored ejuice and the vg/pg/nicotine mixture separate. All individual parts are approved by the FDA. All you have to do is mix the flavor on your own. Boom. LAWYERED.
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*Where is this e-juice ban in effect?  Couldn't you just buy it online and have it shipped to you?
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*Grab yourself a Daedalus from Avid Artisan. Super easy way to make clapton coils. I've heard you can make other coils on there too/ but I typically just stick to making claptons.
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*Exactly!! 😂🤣😂
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*Luckily for me my husband is a build master coil guy. It's lucky for him, too, I guess. It's turned into a little side hustle. He made $20 profit on a set of Rulebreaker/Vahalla coils last night (he built the Vahalla as well).
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*I'm the opposite. Just gotta get that investment to start it.
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*Building is a bit of a learning curve, there are lots of vids on YouTube to help. I make Aliens for cheap as well so if you'd like any shoot me a DM.
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*It's a smarter move, making your own juice cuts the middleman. It's a bit more work but the end result is well worth it.
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*Wait e juice got banned? I thought it was just juul pods specifically.
ezojpi*E-juice chemistry*A L K E M I S

atjass*Every goddamn time*RTA wicking is an art. Don't give up until you get it right. 
atjass*Every goddamn time*I gave up on rta and moved over to squonk because of this. 
atjass*Every goddamn time*I use top airflow and still have this issue.  Especially because I keep my vape in a work vest with a bunch of tools.  No matter what it seems to want to leak at some point in my pocket :/
atjass*Every goddamn time*Try bigger diameter coils.
atjass*Every goddamn time*propably.
atjass*Every goddamn time*The Augvape Intake has been amazing for me. Not a single drop leaked ever. Top airflow air intake with bottom airflow hitting the coil. Ingenious design. Glorious flavor. It does require getting the wicking just right, but it's really not hard to do. Fuck I love my Intake!
atjass*Every goddamn time*Top airflow is the trick! 
atjass*Every goddamn time*I went full squonk and rda until I found top airflow rta. 
atjass*Every goddamn time*Whatch what e-liquid u buy tho
atjass*Every goddamn time*I had this problem as well, tried a few times, still leaking and lots of spitback and condensation coming out the drip tip. Then I tried to deliberately get enough cotton that I was SURE I'd get dry hits on. Worked like a charm. Multiple RTAs later, still works every time.
atjass*Every goddamn time*Or you still don't have the same good flavor you had last time before re-wick... That's my mood right now!
atjass*Every goddamn time*Still happy with my Avocado! Hasn't leaked once. What are you using? 
atjass*Every goddamn time*My tanks have never leaked unless it's really hot outside. But under normal circumstances I've never wrongly wicked an rba, rta, or rdta. It's not really an art you just can't be a dumbass and think an inch of wick will be enough to keep the Eliquid inside lol. I remember actually my first ever time wicking my rba it did leak but after that, never again. I measure my wick with my knife to about half an inch away from the bottom of the tank and cut it there, but it also really depends on how much wick you use, if you're going fat then you'll probably need less slack. It all depends on your build. 
atjass*Every goddamn time*Bought a hugsvape lotus. Had it leak first time, has never leaked once after. It's kind of a like riding a bicycle...
atjass*Every goddamn time*Yall need aromamizer. Could wick it perfectly with a pair of tweezers clenched between my butt cheeks. Its leaked on me once in the last year because i was actually a dumbass that time.

q4biaw*This shit made me laugh*[deleted]
q4biaw*This shit made me laugh*"Classic!!

Good one. Sure he would not like the use of scientific fact showing more people have been killed directly by police action than by Vaping.

Add together those killed directly and indirectly by police action and one could quiet quickly see the Police have caused higher mortality than all illicit drug usage and Vaping combined."

q4biaw*This shit made me laugh*LMAOOOOO… that whole vaping is killing people by giving them EVALI has been debunked for awhile now lol it turns out that black market products have been killing people not authentic store bought stuff lol ever since the news had been exposed for lying about it there hasn’t been any more news about it ever since bc people who were on the news for being in the hospital had said it themselves that the news told them to say it and in fact they bought those things from drug dealers lol so the moral of the story is if your gonna buy anything buy it from a actual store and not some guy off the street!!!

9auv5j*When is it their turn?*I'm waiting for tomatoes and eggplants to have a nicotine warning. 
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*Exactly!! Same with high sugar. Which has been something that is supposed to happen.. Warning labels on pop cans and such.. If they took all there time and energy on banning stupid shit like flavours and spent more time on warning people by labelling high sugar products, then maybe we can help people live healthier lives by cutting down sugar.. But Nope! Let's waste our time banning ejuice flavors so people who are trying to quit smoking or have successfully quit smoking have less of a chance to stay smoke free and pretend they give a shit about people's health. They should be figuring out ways to reward the people who figured out how to make ejuice and helped vaping become an actual real way to successfully quit smoking instead of ruining it!!!
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*"I’m not worried if I get downvotes to oblivion or not. But, this does not compare to the use of a cigarette or a vape. Yes, coffee and the ever so appealing world of craft coffee drinks is very nice and niche to those who want to be trendy. The fact of the matter with most of those drinks though, for Starbucks’ matter, is they have more sugar than caffeine. Their drinks that are aimed for children don’t have any caffeine. People see Starbucks as a status not for the caffeine. People who drink caffeine do use it as a stimulant - same with nicotine. But caffeine hasn’t been abused to the such of nicotine has. It doesn’t have the, stigma. 

I’m not picking sides or saying one is better. But, caffeine does help curve the need for nicotine. Does it need a warning or an age limit? No. Is it as addicting as nicotine? No. Do I drink a cup every morning? Yes. I also vape while i drink it as well. (They go swell together). 

The vape community will be looked as finger pointers and tattle tellers if we keep saying “well what about x,y, and z products?!? They contain so and so!!” We need to take what we have learned - that copyright logos/artwork on labels, and stupid juice names need abandoned and to make this industry for the people it is for. I love fruity and candy flavors. But if you are tossing unicorns and mermaids on a god damn label, you lose my money. I may be missing out on the best juice in the world,  but I can’t give money to someone who is  ripping off another companies logo or trying to look like a comic book strips for kids. I’d rather go with e-juice guy B over there who has a basic label and says his juice is just vanilla strawberry and be done with it. 

I’ll get off my soapbox with this, 

No one ever gained anything, by pointing a finger at those  willing to gain nothing. 



Edit: changed ginger pointers to finger pointers "
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*This is the dumbest strawman I've ever seen. Why not mention sugar instead of caffine? Even then it's not a perfect argument but still. 
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*Caffeine is infamous for causing heart attacks too btw
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*This won’t do us any good
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*So we’re a propaganda sub now. Cool I’m out 
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*"Ban the flavors! *Raises whiskey in celebration*"
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*Well I drink coffee and vape at the same damn time. I don't care if you dont, I dont care if you do. 
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*It comes with a warning in California now...
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*Can't wait for the sugar one.
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*That is 99% sugar, 1% caffeine. 
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*This is chickenshit.  Pointing your finger at someone else to make yourself look good is so lame.
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*And any child can buy a can of soda. 
9auv5j*When is it their turn?*Caffeine is peanuts to nicotine

Neat concept, but not worth the money imo."
coyt6z*Had to go on eBay for this bad boy.*Do they sell these besides ebay or is that a custom box??
coyt6z*Had to go on eBay for this bad boy.*I've seen so many people say they hate this thing because it makes Vapes seem marketed to kids. Kids don't even fucking know what this is supposed to be. I'm nearly 30 and I'm barely old enough to have played Pokemon red when it came out. This is clearly a nostalgia thing for adults, not a kids toy. Go ask a 17 year old if they have any emotional connection to the form factor of a Gameboy color. The Nintendo DS came out right when they stopped breastfeeding.
coyt6z*Had to go on eBay for this bad boy.*Wonder if you can program it to have a small game and not just pictures

coyt6z*Had to go on eBay for this bad boy.*Be cool without the gameboy vibe.
coyt6z*Had to go on eBay for this bad boy.*Because turning a child toy into a mod doesn't make it look like vape is targeting kids or make the community look like shit?  You suck

dz3bjf*Ok boomer*Soooo, has anyone found out what the official reports are? Is it truly narrowed down to black market or THC infused oils(vitamin E acetate?). Been vaping for 8 years after quitting tobacco and I don’t know if it’s simply hysteria and everyone telling me “you’ll die from vaping” but I do have a heavy chest from time to time.. I also smoke tree though, so I’m assuming it’s dirty bowls and not vaping. Has me kinda scared though. -.-

df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*These are good rules to follow. I try really hard not to blow smoke at people. But sometimes it happens even to smokers and I apologize and move with the wind away from people if I can.  Too bad the smokers at work don’t care and blow smoke everywhere including in your face.
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*I've always treated vaping like smoking and won't vape anywhere I wouldn't smoke (with the exception of my own home)
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*"""don't treat them like cigarette butts""

I wish people didn't treat cigarette butts like cigarette butts as well."
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*do people actually throw old coils on the ground?!
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*[deleted]
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*"Don't assume because I vape that it's cool to vape in my house.

Yeah I vape, but I don't want my kids seeing me do it or running through a fog house of nic clouds.

I only vape in certain rooms of the house when kids aren't home."
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*5b. Don't just go spewing out vape information to smokers. Be polite about it and talk about it only if they bring up vaping vs. smoking.
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*If anybody needs to be told 1-4 then they need help in a-lot more areas than vape etiquette.
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*I feel like this is common sense. Even when I'm at the smoke pit at work I stand downwind of the smokers.
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*Its unfortunate that this isn't common sense to all of us who vape. Though I think it can be in due time.
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*STOP LEAVING YOUR FRICKING JUUL PODS IN THE PARKING LOT, CURTIS!
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*Its sad that adults have to be told this basic respectful stuff.
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*"It's sad that this needs to be stated. I smoked for 17 years and was always careful not to blow smoke in anyone's direction and I still do the same with vape. I hated smelling like smoke and would try my best not to smell like I smoked. One of the places I go to has people smoking near the door and the smell of cigarettes makes me nauseous. I live in WA and you aren't allowed to smoke or vape 20 feet from any entrance. I think it's a great law, personally. These people have been told numerous times that they can't even smoke on the property and they stop for a week or so and start right back up. 

When I have people over, I will blow my vape into a towel. I had to do a sleep study a few times and would keep a piece of clothing in there so I could vape. I use a subohm tank, so I have a lot of vapor coming out even with the use of a fan it can still hang out for a bit. I am thinking of trying a pod or something that doesn't produce as much vapor but I don't want to raise my nicotine strength, which is at 6mg. If anyone has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it."
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*"2 is debatable. Especially at smaller vape shops, smaller spaces, the shop can get reaaaally cloudy very quickly, and that kind of thing can be a turn off for customers, especially new customers. Unless they say otherwise, try to keep be a little bit respectful.

Generally, treat vaping like smoking unless you’re told otherwise. My local mall allows vaping everywhere except inside stores and in the food court. Many bars in my area are no smoking, but allow vaping."
df1nhj*Saw on Instagram thought it would fit here*Ok, I'm gonna pass on the advice of someone that says it's water vapor.

dmyxkp*It's all in the name of.... safety.*Army logic: We won't sell something we think might hurt you, but we'll sell something we know will kill you.
dmyxkp*It's all in the name of.... safety.*This is stupid. Tobacco is slow suicide while vaping won’t kill you.

I don’t care if this is willie Nelson’s personal shit he grows in the bathroom of his tour bus! No, I’m not doing it again, last time I woke up in the dumpster behind Arby’s! I’m going!” Pause for three seconds.....”Fuck, if I take one hit will you leave me the fuck alone?!” Pause for two seconds...”Fuck it, send it over and shut the fuck up!” Apologize to your guest maybe give them a fake “I’m so sorry” with a single finger in the air for the just a moment thing and then take a huge hit. After they pick up their exploded heads from watching this unfold apologize and offer them the phone for a taste. Boom!

bge1s6*I vape too, but this made me chuckle 😅*People at work say I smoke a robot dildo so this actually kinda cool.
bge1s6*I vape too, but this made me chuckle 😅*"Ah yeah, I rather have a nicotine dependency from a flash drive over smoking nasty ass cigarettes.

edit: I hit comment too soon."
bge1s6*I vape too, but this made me chuckle 😅*i feel like now as a vaper a lot of people that i see smoking cigarettes most likely just hesitate to switch to vaping due to the laziness of smoking cigarettes itself. just take one out the box. light it up. smoke it. chuck it. i feel like in their minds it's too much dam work for vaping. build the coil, place the coil, wick the coil, get those special batteries, etc etc etc. too many steps in the mind of a hardened smoker. no one gives me any gruff during my smoke breaks but i mostly get the oh look at this posh mother fk'r look from people while i vape and they puff on their sticks.
bge1s6*I vape too, but this made me chuckle 😅*Oh man if my vape doubled as a flash drive that would be sweet 😅
bge1s6*I vape too, but this made me chuckle 😅*jjjuuuuuuuuullll.

bat2hx*I don't think that's how it works...*Good, e cigs suck. We use vaporizers.
bat2hx*I don't think that's how it works...*Clearly that’s a one color representation of a mech mod with a flared tip and a venting battery. I agree. No venting batteries should be allowed. 
bat2hx*I don't think that's how it works...*Haha “my subie runs on straight vg”
bat2hx*I don't think that's how it works...*That's clearly a no smoking graphic with the sides of a cigarette tip cut off and with plus & minus signs applied. They couldn't bear to put any effort into it. 
bat2hx*I don't think that's how it works...*Unless it’s a Smok mod 😂

buz35m*Interesting perspective*"I dunno man. In a month I rewick like 10-15 times

But still. Way way less waste. At a pack a day. That’s 600 cigarette butts a month!"
buz35m*Interesting perspective*Maybe I’m blind but what is that even? Coils? Hard to tell lol. Also I probably use a few pods a month but still a pretty massive difference between the two.
buz35m*Interesting perspective*You gotta factor in juice bottles as well
buz35m*Interesting perspective*I guess they dont use cotton
buz35m*Interesting perspective*"But... But... But... The reaper rides a heavy metal sled, that can leak toxic nickle, toxic lead (plus nicotine)

Guys guys wtf vaping is bad why aren't you guys listening to us... Guys???"
buz35m*Interesting perspective*"Looks like two weed carts lmao 


Still any way you cut it cigarette filters are one of the top, if not top, pollutants/garbage throughout the world.


Metal/glass/cotton are recyclable or degradable 


Only bad thing vape has over cigarettes is lithium farming for batteries, and even then that’s debatable."
buz35m*Interesting perspective*I am totally using this for my Vape stores facebook page. Thank you. Wonderful perspective. Save the planet. Give me my straws back and take my butts.
buz35m*Interesting perspective*Pods need to be regulated. Imagine instead of cigarette butts all over the place there are empty plastic pods. FDA and EPA would be on our asses so quick.
buz35m*Interesting perspective*I wonder how many disposable lighters are thrown out each month as well
buz35m*Interesting perspective*"And plastic and glass bottles, and the packaging from the coils, the fuel to drive to and from the store...or delivery, the manufacturing pollution, the everything. 

This is an inaccurate representation.

Before people jump to conclusions, been vaping 5 years. Just pointing out how this graphic is incomplete."
buz35m*Interesting perspective*I wanna meet whoever smokes that much. Jesus fuck
buz35m*Interesting perspective*I dunno man I used a lot of high quality napkins to clean my vape.
buz35m*Interesting perspective*"what about ejuice bottles?   


also what is even in the picture?"
buz35m*Interesting perspective*Yeah but what about these new pod systems? No way those disposable bits of plastic are any better, at least without recycling programs from the pod makers...
buz35m*Interesting perspective*I think this forgets things like plastic bottles and packaging. Also, smoking kills people and people are the worse thing for the environment so ;)
9lp4il*Preach it*Fucking hate todays parents. they just don't understand.
9lp4il*Preach it*"""Waaaah, we need to put restrictions in place for everyone because we can't be arsed to actually keep tabs on our kids."""
9lp4il*Preach it*Mommy should really consider that logic the next time she drinks a daiquiri, mai tai, piña colada, mimosa... I remember thinking that those drinks looked so cool as a child.
9lp4il*Preach it*The lollipop is probably worse for that kid than unicorn poop.
9lp4il*Preach it*I'm sick of this shit. People always get caught up on kids vaping. I don't think kids should be vaping either but the restrictions they are trying to put in place are just going to make it more appealing to kids and more expensive and difficult for adults to access vaping. It's an aid to quit smoking, not a fashion statement. Period.
9lp4il*Preach it*The whole Anti-Vaping brigade is funded by Big Tobacco
9lp4il*Preach it*"Other things that appeal to young adults 


1. Unprotected sex
2. Wood grain alcohol
3. Sade
4. Tattoos
5. Bad life choices


I guess the rest of us are going to have to suffer and give up these things because they're idiots."
9lp4il*Preach it*I don't see how we've gotten to this point where people feel like they're entitled to decide what other people can and can't put into their own body. 
9lp4il*Preach it*My father asked me questions the other day, wanting to understand. He sees the negative 'studies', but still felt he should ask me to understand what the risks truly are. Everyone should be doing this, don't know the answer? Ask someone who does. Not the media.
9lp4il*Preach it*As a vaper, and a parent, this initates face palm for me. You know why your kids are doing it? They think it makes them look cool. Change their definition of cool.
9lp4il*Preach it*op was that your doing?
9lp4il*Preach it*In order to get one of these, you'd probably have to get a parent's credit card. Who's fault is that? Parents. Totally agree, shitton of bad parenting these days. You can helicopter but you can't let them do anything they want.
9lp4il*Preach it*Love allllll of this 
9lp4il*Preach it*Just can't believe this...
9lp4il*Preach it* But cigarettes and alcohol STILL get a free pass.

Or a rough example.

4v/0.5 Ohms = 8 amps

8x4 = 36w.

I say approximate because in reality we have v drop, battery sag, loss of charge and (wire depending) even temperature related variance in resistance so its not exact but it's a good ballpark figure. "

abr8gl*Yeah kinda.....*I feel like anytime something is 18+ itll be easy for a high schooler to get it. I smoked cigarettes in high school along with maybe 25 percent of my school. They taste terrible and we didnt care. We didnt even really have trouble finding someone to buy us alcohol, but it was slightly more difficult. Kids are always going to get into the things you dont want them in 
abr8gl*Yeah kinda.....*Kids are always gonna do shit they aren’t supposed to. Fucking 16 year olds are either gonna be juuling or doing something worse. Would you rather have kids trying shit like heroin and xan or have them try a drug with a similar makeup to caffeine 
abr8gl*Yeah kinda.....*Juul's are stupid compared to like the novo or the sourin
abr8gl*Yeah kinda.....*"Well good because i think tanks are a better way to go.. or non prefilled pods.

If we just dump the juul already and lay low we avoid the flak.. pun non intended"
abr8gl*Yeah kinda.....*"More like...


“How can we end vaping at all costs?” 

Because that’s exactly what they want to do. Way too much of a threat to the tobacco industry and they’re beginning to fear its growing to the point where banning it all will cease to be a possibility. First it’s Juuls, then it’s flavors, then come tanks, etc. These devices are marketed towards adults 21 and older. They never have and never will be marketed towards children. This attack on pod systems is an excuse to push harsh regulations and get the vape industry to start giving in. "
abr8gl*Yeah kinda.....*"How about... do something more to stop merchants from selling ""adult"" things to minors! 

"
abr8gl*Yeah kinda.....*Rip mango pods :/ I blame the children for this
abr8gl*Yeah kinda.....*Here in finland teachers dont even care about smoking after the age of 15, there are literally marked places where you can smoke on some schools. People use snus, cigs and vape, and teachers dont mind. And it was really easy to get alcohol and even weed when i was at the age of 15-17
abr8gl*Yeah kinda.....*As far as in concerned, the juul is not the problem, nor is personal cape devices. The real issue here is big tobacco and supposedly a-political entities (FDA, DHS, and the Surgeon General) being in bed together. It is a demonstrable truth that big tobacco has been in the pockets (and ears) of politicians and the institutions listed above for decades; just look at cigarette comercials from the 50's and 60's...cigarettes were actually endorsed and promoted by doctors, the SG, and FDA. The question that needs to be asked is: who, in the Trump administration, is a stakeholder in the financial well-being of big tobacco and has the most to gain from big tobacco climbing back to the pinnacle of the market.....that's the real question that needs to be asked.
abr8gl*Yeah kinda.....*Shit. The government can’t keep guns out of 15 year old kids hands down in downtown Newport News. No law has ever prevented a crime.

l8yv48*Apparently were all vaping battery water*"Just delete Facebook. No really, do it. Regardless of what you use it for, Facebook logs your activity (however limited) and uses it to produce user profiles that help them abuse loopholes in human psychology and trick people in your age group with friends who like the things yours do and interests like yours into spending more time on Facebook so they can collect more ad revenue. 

There is a reason making an account is free. *You* are the product. Not your willingness to click on a link. Not how long *you* specifically look at their site. You. Who you are and what makes you tick. That's what they mean by ""data collection"". That's the data. They don't care what you ate for lunch. Their algorithms distill people down into their lowest common denominators and then use that information to show other users *anything* that makes them stick around longer. Whether that's a conspiracy theory or pictures of ducks. This is how Qanon, flatearth, anti-maskers, etc. all became mainstream. 

Facebook uses people who ""barely use it"" to identify behavioral loopholes so that they can convince other people that reality doesn't exist. Not for nefarious purposes, it just happens to be what most idiots like to look at. Just like tabloids and most mainstream media, it's profit via drama. Has been for decades. Your Facebook profile helps train their algorithms to more effectively spread that drama to other people. 

Facebook is actively harming our society. Dump that shit."

I was 100% wrong, in fact most people once i spoke with them congratulated me on recently quiting stinkied and were extremely friendly and full of advice. It was a fantastic weekend and i made lots of new friends in the vape community.

The fact that this woman has taken the steps to become a heather smoker is one thing.. but the fact that she’s your mother OP...


...Now, hopefully, she’ll get to spend many more years with you and the rest of your loved ones. I hope that she’ll get to see birthdays, wedding, births, holidays and everything else grand among the family that she may otherwise have missed if she had continued to smoke the cancer sticks.


One by one, they’re slowly switching over to a healthier alternative and, although we may not be saving lives, we may be prolonging death and that’s a win in my book."

9n61u9*40+ years of smoking. Today marks one week of vaping after her last smoke. Congratulations Mom!!!!!*"That’s awesome. I bought my mom a vape and she only uses it intermittently. Still smoking. Guess the nicotine in the juice isn’t strong enough. It’s a Tobacco flavor and she likes it but just can’t down the damn pall malls. We had a 45 min trip in her car and I swear her smoking was awful. She rolls down the window but I still reeked of smoke, my head pounded till nausea. It got worse with each light up. The next day on the way home. She sits all antsy like and said “I’m sorry but I have to smoke.”  She lit up and the smell came back, my head started hurting and the burning cigarette seemed to go on forever. I finally told her to please put it out. That I was not simply complaining, it is giving me a headache. Wtf did I buy her the vape for. I have no idea how I used to smoke cigarettes. The second hand gets worse and worse as time goes on. Maybe it’s her brand that bothers me. 

My dad liked the idea but also didn’t stick with it. It’s like they work to find flaws in vaping so they can light up. Frustrating. "

9n61u9*40+ years of smoking. Today marks one week of vaping after her last smoke. Congratulations Mom!!!!!*Awesome! My mom smoked for as long and was diagnosed with emphyzema about 3 years ago. So I decided to ditch the analogs and get myself a decent setup to ease the transition. I thought this would encourage my mom to kick the habit for good. Gave her my Nautilus that I wasn't using anymore so she could have a decent vape. It's been three years without smoking for my mom and I and we're all the better for it. We'll even bring up vaping gear when I talk to her on the phone(she's got herself a nice Vaporesso Tarot kit!). Cheers!
9n61u9*40+ years of smoking. Today marks one week of vaping after her last smoke. Congratulations Mom!!!!!*What device is she using? Looks pretty stealthy!
9n61u9*40+ years of smoking. Today marks one week of vaping after her last smoke. Congratulations Mom!!!!!*Congrats to your mom! Tell her it gets easier and easier the longer she sticks with it! And here I thought my 20 years of smoking was a long time. After 40 years of smoking that is amazing that she is doing so well with making the transition! She is truly an inspiration for all of us and that should help show anyone here that may be struggling with staying off cigarettes if she can make the switch and stick with it after 40 years of smoking, the others here that are struggling can as well!
9n61u9*40+ years of smoking. Today marks one week of vaping after her last smoke. Congratulations Mom!!!!!*Yay, Mom. Congratulations.

655sc0*When I finally get off the plane after a long flight*No that I have done it cause it's illegal but if you did vape in the bathroom. Inhale like you are smoking weed don't let a lot of vapor out and exhale down it won't set off the smoke detectors.. I was told by a friend try it at your own risk..

odqwyx*My life currently…*I was going to say that a $1200 mod is ridiculous, until I remembered that I have yet another Billet on the way that I definitely don't need. Some of us just have a problem.

odqwyx*My life currently…*There's wasting money, and then there's buying a $1200 mod.
odqwyx*My life currently…*Gave up spending on hardware over a year ago. It was the right thing for me to do and I'm glad I did it. Got a great collection, never get bored because of the endless combos on offer - and I've saved a good couple of grand, which was the main reason for switching from smoking to vaping in the first place.
odqwyx*My life currently…*Y’all are crazy 😆
odqwyx*My life currently…*"500$ is totally justifiable, and i draw the line at that.

But i testrode a 21k$ motorcycle the other day, and I‘m kinda tempted.."
odqwyx*My life currently…*Wait… there’s mods for $1200?!
odqwyx*My life currently…*I have a good setup, but I just need that new rda that does the exact same thing as my old one!
odqwyx*My life currently…*Think I remember when I was 30. Then again 🤔
odqwyx*My life currently…*i don't think i'd spend 1200 on a mod lol. maybe if i had like a high 6 figure bank account i would indulge myself to one or two 1000 plus mods lol

aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*In case you are actually having these problems, drip more often and you should never get a dry hit, and if you are getting spitback, wick harder and bump your wattage up to the correct range.
aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*Squonk mod ftw 
aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*Can someone explain to me the appeal of RDA with all these great mesh tanks that have great coil life and phenomenal flavor.
aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*Drop. Drop Dead. Bonza. All have fallen to the wayside now that I figured out how to work the Profile. I still love the flavor on my Bonza, but man, the Profile is the whole package 
aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*Or just go mesh
aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*Me as fuck. Just got mine a week ago 
aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*Does cotton length matter .? More or less ?

aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*it all makes sense now.... 
aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*Shit. My first RDA, a squonker, arrives tomorrow. Should I be worried? Lol
aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*Got my first rda about a month ago and my second one monday. Never going back. It makes vaping so much cooler/enjoyable 
aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*Switching from an RDA to the Novo was the best decision ever made
aldkjs*Using your first RDA be like*"If you get spitback it's a smart idea to build higher ohm / thinner wire etc. Don't build too low with for example SS316 you will need ongodly amounts of power and preferably some boost/preheat which many mods don't have 

1.Purge 

2. Wick tighter 

3. Don't use too much juice 

4. Raise your wattage 


Although I will get attacked for this. Avoid the FUCK out of the DROP rda..people swear by it and pretend like it's he best RDA ever. But it sucks donkey dick.and is a spitback machine..it has great flavor but that's about it. 

I haven't checked the reviews in a while since I'm.content with my 3 profile RDA's. I would suggest you buy a profile RDA or.if you really want a regular RDA or RTA instead go watch some recent reviews. Companies constantly bring out rnw and better stuff so don't go an buy something from 2016/2017. Buy a new rda/rta. If you can't find it locally best order it from China. (Although I really hate the CCP and don't want to buy from China everything is from China anyway) 

It's cheaper it and they have(make) ALL popular  rda/RTAs just takes a week or two to arrive

cuq77o*I agree*"Ha ha I started vaping only around maybe 5 to 6 weeks ago and only started to not cough during my first vape of the day.

Mind you smoking cigs made me cough all day, itvwas quite disgusting.... I mean like general grevious style coughing.

Now my cough has almost completely cleared up. Suppose my lungs are very damaged but they seems to be healing fairly rapidly."

cuq77o*I agree*The longest I go without vaping is at night while I'm asleep. I hadn't thought about it before, but 8 hours is the longest I've gone without vaping since I quit smoking in 2013.

All in all shoud cost around $300-$400. Between the premixed and DIY it should last about a year or more....
d3u60s*Keep your hands off my Razzberry Rush!*I love it
d3u60s*Keep your hands off my Razzberry Rush!*There is no way they would be able to ban flavoring seperately.  The flavoring is used in so many products.  I know if you want to make candy you use the same flavor concentrates.  The only thing the vape companies could do would be to sell their own blend of flavor concentrates.  I have a feeling if they start selling unflavored juice, you will have idiots trying to add mccormick flavors from their local walmart to their juice.

You need a new vape."
a4q4hn*How to tell if you need a new vape*"I have one and I love it. But I do need a second one for sure. I left it in my friend's car yesterday after work, and she couldn't get it to me till she got to work today at 2.   

I had to smoke some cigarettes. They were gross. Like really gross. And completely unsatisfying compared to big satisfying clouds filled with nicotine goodness.   

I was honestly surprised how bad they tasted, smelled, and made me feel. Coughing and scratchy throat and that gross taste in your mouth. I got my baby back today. I'll be washing all my clothes tonight when I get home.   

If you only have one, definitely have a backup for cases like that. Lesson learned!!"
a4q4hn*How to tell if you need a new vape*I need to show this to my Mrs. It’ll help my cause of buying a new set up.

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with a vaping room with an airport but sometimes it’s good to just not vape for a matter of hours
gpvyeg*Please*just use the smoking area
gpvyeg*Please*So true. Singapore Changi has an open air smoking zone. I wish other airports followed this.
gpvyeg*Please*They do. They're called toilet cubicles.
gpvyeg*Please*[deleted]
gpvyeg*Please*yup.
gpvyeg*Please*"When I went to Vegas to get married in 2001 I was surprised to see that McCarran Airport had a glassed-in smoking room in the terminal. No doors on the two entrances to the room, just thick plastic sheeting in strips hung like a curtain. It kept the smoke within the room by negative pressure and heavy filtration.

That was long before vaping, and even smoker's weren't yet considered to be worse than Hitler. I imagine the slot machines in the smoking room paid for its upkeep also."
gpvyeg*Please*I disagree. Although vaping smoke(cloud) is safe for the third person, still it can encourage smoking in underage teens or children.
gpvyeg*Please*We can’t even have designated vaping JUICES in NYC, let alone Designated airport spaces. :(
gpvyeg*Please*What about the trick in the airplane restroom where you can flush and blow smoke into the toilet and the suction pulls it out ?? (in no way trying to advocate breaking the law, but genuinely curious if anyone else has tried)
gpvyeg*Please*I had the same issue over in MIA, smoking section closed due to the virus but all duty free stores and cafes open.

p2mlj6*Relatable*I blow the first puff away with another puff.
p2mlj6*Relatable*Actually thats how i used to drive
p2mlj6*Relatable*So true!!! I  probably lose a measurable amount productivity due to this, and messing around with my mods
p2mlj6*Relatable*In case you don't know vaping near your computer is bad for the long-term health of your computer. The vegetable glycerin sticks to the components and promotes dust buildup which decreases thermal dissipation. Honestly I still vape by my computer because idc but some people do care about that stuff.
p2mlj6*Relatable*Just get a little usb desk fan lol
p2mlj6*Relatable*Substitute the monitor for a TV, phone, or my build tray, and that's exactly accurate 👍😂
p2mlj6*Relatable*"I just blow it to the side or over the monitor... who blows AT the monitor lol

(I’m on the computer 16-18 hrs per day)"
p2mlj6*Relatable*All day, everyday!
p2mlj6*Relatable*Same, worst part is I do this while I'm in Warzone
p2mlj6*Relatable*felt
p2mlj6*Relatable*Very exactly how come I sometimes hate playing video games
p2mlj6*Relatable*Hahaha that's true
p2mlj6*Relatable*I really want to vape in my room instead of my bathroom, but I’m terrified of the smoke alarms going off (even though it’s never happened). How do people deal with smoke alarms when vaping?
p2mlj6*Relatable*Why is vaping more enjoyable the less wind there is. Like my preferred vape. Is chucking a FAT cloud in a basically windless room. Like why? 😂
p2mlj6*Relatable*I am puffing while work at the moment
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*Well Jesus if they’re charging $25 for 60mL and $35 for 100mL it’s no wonder they’re able to absorb the tax.
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*35 for 100ml, lol. Yeh, good guy, smh.
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*Had me in the first half..... FFS those prices are insane as is. I understand B&M stores have overhead costs but this shit is just out fucking ragous seriously. I can get like 400-600ml of premium popular brand juice for the same price as their in house line 100ml.... fucking absurd.
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*They can take the hit because they’re already fucking you on juice. A 120 ml bottle of juice costs less than $2 to make.
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*I work at a brick and mortar store and we sell 18 dollar 100 mls, even if we got taxed harder and raised the price to match that it would still be cheaper than this store.
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*Holy crap that is expensive, no wonder B&M's struggle.
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*"Was sat there reading think ohh what a nice dude for doing that. Then I got to the prices, ""willing to take the heavy tax hit"" you mean your already overpriced so it doesn't even matter to take a small hit, so glad I took up DIY, and I only buy ""premium"" eliquid when it's on huge sales on sites like washintonvapes. 

I got 500ml for £20 ""25dollars"" the other week."
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*Holy hell that's some 2013 prices
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*My shop here in NE Ohio is also doing this. They said they will not be able to do it forever, but for now, they are absorbing the tax on all eliquid....not the customer❤️
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*100ml for 35??? That's outrageous
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*25$? I got 60ml for 18$ in store
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*"""we already overcharge you so we'll cover the tax and still be quids in"""
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*I'm pretty sure they are covering their tax, and taking no hits at those prices . . .
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*🤣🤣🍆
dgjvyb*Good guy vape shop 💜*Holy shit. 10 cent tax per mL...rip
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*There used to be a family owned shop that had a younger woman working there and my friend asked her to build his rda once and she stuck cotton in it then pulsed it for hot spots.
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*I'd agree with this all over, until I found my current shop. Dude(shop owner) is like a vape encyclopedia, I'd never retain the information he has. So depends on the shop.
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*As someone who works at a Vape Shop, we are only trying to help. How am I supposed to know how much vaping knowledge you have when you walk through the door?
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*"Also side note: most retail employees are required by management to ask this question. In my shop nothing is within access of the customer either, this includes stock, tools, cotton supplies, devices, drinks, etc. It keeps us involved with the customer and theft rates low. 
"
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*"There's an idiot at my shop running one of those ""Hohm Tech"" or ""Hohm Life"" 20700 in his mech. He believes the 47.8 amp rating it has and is running a .09 ohm build in it."
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*Can't tell if you're the cockiest kid on the block or your local shop sucks
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*"There’s a local shop a ways past my work building that had the greatest employee ever, taught me everything I know about rda building and mechanical mod safety and gave me such great juice recommendations. Also he was a fellow fan of metal and punk music so that was a plus. Sadly he left and last I heard was going to culinary school, I hope he aces the shit out of that. Such a good dude. 

The people they have now I think know a bit more about herbal vaping than e juice vaping which I don’t mind, but they had my business for a full year purely on heading in there for technical talk. I always left that place with something just because I felt like they definitely earned my business. "
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*"This is correct in my town, went in to buy a couple of spare 18650s. Dude just hands me the batteries no case or sleeves for the batteries, just handed to me like loose change. Then I hasked for a case and he said ""the cases for batteries are 2.99""

Thats the first and last time I ever go into a local shop here in my town. "
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*The shops around me suck. I only get my juice from one local store because they give me a law enforcement discount. We responded to a call there and while I was waiting for the bus I pulled out my vape. I was immediately showered with free shit and told to come back for a discount. 
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*[deleted]
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*I’ve had one shop in Lancaster Ohio that was actually very helpful teaching me how to build my first coil.  After that the only questions I had are “Do you have “ “ in stock?  Why the fuck not?
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*Obviously this is a joke post, but in case anyone is for real, don't be like that, lol. It's not quite vapes but I sell watches and the amount of guys that come in and tell me they know more than me/that I don't carry quality pieces usually take about 3 minutes to either say something completely incorrect or look at me like I have 6 heads when I mention something basic to any hobbyist. In other words, don't assume your retailer is uninformed just because they dumb it down to the lowest common denominator. 
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*Very troubling how little these shops really know. The one I found that I went to many times I thought seemed to know their shit but the area manager was just clueless. But adamant he was so knowledgable. Just didn’t keep up on upcoming products or what’s good “our delivery comes next week” was their catch phrase 
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*"See all this is totally freaking me out. I bought a Firelord Conquer for cheap.. My first box mod with an RBA. I'm allergic to nickel. Not deadly so but I've never ""smoked it"". I can't wear cheap jewelry and have to paint the backside of pant buttons with clear nail polish.. I wrap the buckle of belts in tape etc.. I will need coils for this mod.. But when I did attempt to do some online window shopping I found it was hard to find what they were made of. I'm gonna go with stainless steel for now. I also don't know if the Firelord is compatible with kanthal. I'm planning a trip to the vape shop closest to me.. Hoping they can help but this isn't giving me much hope. Lol "
9gw3g2*When a vape shop employee asks if you have any questions*Funny, that's how us employees feel too.

4i9skq*If eliquids are a tobacco product*Since we're banning things with nicotine in them we may as well ban tomatoes as well.
4i9skq*If eliquids are a tobacco product*And eggplant

4i9skq*If eliquids are a tobacco product*Just going to play the other side here, my fiance drinks diet coke for the caffeine all the time. You'd be surprised how much caffeine is in a diet coke.

4i9skq*If eliquids are a tobacco product*Coffee isn't regulated though, so..
4i9skq*If eliquids are a tobacco product*There's coke in a rum and coke? Coke is now an alcohol product. Sorry kiddos, no soda with those kids meals without seeing an ID.

just hit it like it owes you money while your brain ""rewires"" during transitioning.

and welcome to the sub,  we are here to help you in this journey."
fi43gp*First 24 hours without a cigarette in 11 years. Done!*Congratulations! Keep it up, the first week is the hardest, but totally possible! If you like the Juul, look at the Uwell Caliburn, it has even better flavour and you can choose the juice and flavour you want to put in it!
fi43gp*First 24 hours without a cigarette in 11 years. Done!*Holy shit. You guys are the best!
fi43gp*First 24 hours without a cigarette in 11 years. Done!*That is a nice massive first step!
fi43gp*First 24 hours without a cigarette in 11 years. Done!*As much as some people talk shit on juul. It was the device that finally helped me quit cigs.   9 months later and 5 devices later I’m still off them, but juul was the starting point for me too!

Good luck you got this!"

fi43gp*First 24 hours without a cigarette in 11 years. Done!*Congratulations on the first step, the battle is real but you can do it.
fi43gp*First 24 hours without a cigarette in 11 years. Done!*"Congratulations.

Ignore the idiot trying to bring you down. Some dumbasses cannot allow others to be happy unless it is done their way, and they have to get in on the attention. Enjoy your success.

I quit with a Juul and I think it worked well. If and when you’re ready to upgrade and save money, I would suggest you take a look at the Crown pod system by Uwell. It's basically an improved Caliburn. If you want something with a little more options and power, the Aegis Boost by GeekVape is my favorite device. Just my thoughts. Enjoy being smoke-free and your improving health. Again, congratulations."
fi43gp*First 24 hours without a cigarette in 11 years. Done!*I kept saying everyday that there are no cigarettes for me. Keep saying that until you don't need to. Now I keep saying that about alcohol.

fi43gp*First 24 hours without a cigarette in 11 years. Done!*"Grats if there's a device that helped me quit cigs it was the juul. It really simulates the hit of a cig the most, though I have explored other pod options after around 6 months mainly due to the expense haha. 

Great job man/woman, keep it going, it gets so much easier after a few days."
fi43gp*First 24 hours without a cigarette in 11 years. Done!*Congratulations!  You are doing it right!

I don't expect you to read the book below, but PLEASE SIGN AND SHARE with everyone you possibly can. Please and thank you.

As someone who works in the industry what's completely nonsense is that the flavor ban announced today is almost completely because of illigal black market THC cartidges, there have only been between 75 - 80 of the 450+ who claimed to only use nicotine. But to my knowledge not one of those people has been drug tested to see if they are lying. And allot of people have good reason to lie, for instance jobs, family, hell getting your child taken away even though you are a victim. This is going to cost thousands of people their jobs on every single level of this industry. All because these people want to look good with a bipartisan issue on an election year. Please if you care at all about thousands of people's jobs sign this! I agree the industry needs regulations, but this is not how you do it! Allot of small businesses will go under at a staggering speed with no recourse because this happened so suddenly. Please as someone with a wife and kid, as well as many employees and associates in the same situation PLEASE don't let this just be the end of an entire industry overnight. It benefits nobody but Altria and other big tobacco companies. Altria owns 30% of juul plus almost every other gas station vape there is. That accounts for 70% or more of the entire vape industry. Even if they lose 30% - 40% sales because of lack of flavors that's fine because they will bounce back come 2020 when you can petition for your flavors back. That other 30% of the industry that isn't juul or gas station crap will complete be ruined practically overnight. That's all the small business owners, production companies, flavor scientists, sales people we all know those. All of these will just be gone, most of them don't have the money or resources to last till the 2020 review. And even if they could somehow scrape by the couldn't hope to afford what it takes to be approved. The communities that people have built to have a better life after smoking will also disappear. This will do so much more harm than good by also starting a giant black market of homemade liquid that will FOR SURE get people sick for way more money. If you give even half a damn, I can not stress enough how much it would mean to so many people if you please sign and share this before time runs out. I apologise profusely for the bad Grammer and spelling. I never comment, and to be honest I don't fully even understand how reddit really works but this means allot."
d1ikwv*“ vaping entices children with flavors” let’s put a fu king coloring box on a pack of smokes*Neither vaping nor this is marketed towards children.
d7ipnd*I'll stick with a public official.*"*public health professor instead of, ""so what""."
d7ipnd*I'll stick with a public official.*"One thing I hate about this society we live in, is that there are so many people who refuse to change how they thing about something. People will fight tooth and nail defending this ban because they believe that ""vaping is going to kill you"". Regardless of how much evidence you present them that vaping is the lesser of two evils."
d7ipnd*I'll stick with a public official.*Let's get the story straight. Juul and illegal thc cartridges are the cause of lung issues. I have vaped regular mods with regular flavored juice for 4 years or so. My oxygen levels are at 100% as of today.(I'm in the er for unrelated issues) but here states go banning flavors for kids. Banning juuls and legalizing weed is what needs to happen. The government is the cancer in our society and they are literally going to harm us to prove a point that doesnt exist. If they ban juuls kids are going to smoke cigarettes.
d7ipnd*I'll stick with a public official.*"They're always saying that they are against vaping because they don't want the kids to have access to an addictive stimulant, nicotine. 

Well, what are they doing about that other kid flavored addictive stimulant, found in hundreds of products, that all kids of all ages have easy access to, caffeine?

Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Mountain Dew, Redbull, Monster, Bang, or Reign to name just a few."
d7ipnd*I'll stick with a public official.*Stick a tax on it like we have with cigarettes and the governments of the world will suddenly be happy to support it.
d7ipnd*I'll stick with a public official.*"My wife and i, as well as a couple dozen friends, have used 0% nicotine e-juice for a bunch of years now. Without addicting tobacco driving it, we no longer need nic!

My e-juice guy is a friend of mine. My wife and I used to use 24mg of nicotine, 36mg if I made my own. He freaked out and said, ""Try 6mg and see what you think?"" I have a bottle of nicotine in the fridge, so I figured if I have withdrawals, I'd just add a bunch to the juice? Turns out that 6mg didn't bother me at all, so I dropped it to zero ""just to see"" and the wife followed suit. Then our friends did too.

43 years of Marlboros long behind me!"

1t168j*I've been smoke free for over 2 weeks now!*I switched to ecigs 3 years ago and never looked back.  That said it's still anecdotal evidence.  Mindset still has a lot to do with it I think.  I was finally ready to quit and ecigs came along at just the right time for me.  
1t168j*I've been smoke free for over 2 weeks now!*Good for you.  Keep it up.
1t168j*I've been smoke free for over 2 weeks now!*"I'm not sure why the story is gone on imgur, but here it is again. I've been an avid smoker for over 22 years. A buddy of mine who is a ""vaper"" decided to make a site out of frustration during searching around for the best prices. So I as a front end developer decided to help him out, during my assistance with him I decided to check out vaping myself. I've been without a cigarette for two weeks (my entire family smokes constantly.) now and couldn't be happier. I still have a want to grab a smoke out of the pack, but then I just give my vape a whack and I'm all good. I would personally like to thank the vape community! You all are wonderful."

What juice is that BTW?"
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*I honestly don't even want one fancier than what I have.  I've moved up to a iTaste with a Evok tank.  I see people with huge mods, and that's great, but I don't really have an urge to escalate it into a hobby, for me it's just a smoking replacement, but I'm in no hurry to get rid of it, either.  Vary your flavors; It'll help.
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*"Virtually everyone here started on an eGo battery combo of one style or another, so don't let anyone tell you that you bought the wrong equipment. If it keeps you from cigarettes, it is the right equipment.

My first was an eGo 900mAh and Protank 2 mini kit from Vape Dojo. Eventually I upgraded and passed my eGo kit to a co-worker who is now 3 months free from cigarettes and has passed the kit on himself."
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*"Congrats! This is really all one needs to give up the analogs. I started on eGo 900s and still use 'em to this day actually, no matter how much shit others give me for it. :) You can always upgrade to heavier gear if the bug hits you.

PS. Don't cave when you think you want a smoke. Just vape it and the craving will go away, likely, immediately. The memories I have of smoking are far better than the reality. Being around an actual cigarette is quite unappealing these days."

27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*"HEY! I bought that same unit yesterday! Congratulations! I made the change yesterday and I'm super stoked someone else did the same.

I was on my way back home from work and realized I ran out of cigs. My immediate thought was 'I can cold turkey it, I can do this' and when I folded, I turned into a gas station. THE MOMENT I turned in, my eyes fixed onto a small shop in the plaza behind the station called 'Smoke Less'. I thought it was a HUGE coincidence. So I thought, fuck it, let's try it. I walked in, the lady was super nice, she pointed out a few machines, let me try a few liquids. I walked out a changed man and I had the largest smile on my face the entire ride home."
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*It’s not a fashion show… if it works for you, well, then it works.  And if you’re happy with it, that’s all that matters.  One of the big pluses of vaping gear is the interchangeability.  So if you want more than 1.6ml of liquid you can add a different clearomizer. Hell, even an Aspire Nautilus (5ml capacity) can be used with an eGo style battery. It looks a little funny, but it works.
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*The best gear is what works for you. You may decide to upgrade sometime but it really isn't required. The main thing is to enjoy and celebrate your new-found freedom from cigarettes :)
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*We all had to start somewhere brah.
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*I have an eGO-T and love it! I like the small pen-sized units better. The big ones seem clunky and require a special carrying case for transport. With this, I can easily carry it in the same bag as my wallet and phone.
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*How long does that battery last for you? Mine lasts maybe an hour. 
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*Welcome to the throng. I bought roughly the same thing five months ago, except I chose a bigger battery. (That 1300 mAh really makes a difference.) I am now five months analog-free and loving it!
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*Congrats!
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*"I totally recommend ditching the clearomizer for a better tank.  You'll get better flavor with a better tank.  Too drunk right now to remember brands lol, I need to slow down.  

The clearomizer always tasted plasticky to me, though I do a lot of flavors like blueberry cheesecake, jabbas hookah, and strawberry."
27vhw3*May not be as fancy as what a lot of you are rockin, but today is the day I quit smoking and start vaping.*"Good for you! I started with a Silver Surfer batt a buddy sent me for christmas last year with a disposable tank. Moved up to a Kanger eGo, then upgraded to the E-LVT with a Kayfun, now I'm waiting on my Kamry K100 to go with the Atomic RBA I got for free. 

All in the space of like, 6 months. Shit's more addictive than analongs, mayn. Have fun."

I felt the same exact way, started just 357 days ago and not one stinky since.  One year will be soon : )

BTW - I found the whole coil building thing a great way to ween off that ""something's missing"" felling those first few weeks of quitting - it kept my hands busy.  Otherwise, not ever having a nic-fit, made quitting analogs the easiest part.

Happy for you and yes, a really nice set up you have there."

20ckat*Why e-cigarette can be the most awesome thing ever and why they aren't yet.*Good post. I've recently changed to vaping from analogs after 30 years smoking up to 50 a day. I asked for advice in here and the answer could have been in Russian for all I understood. Thankfully the guy came back and explained the terms he used. I got a starter kit Tornade mega ecog+) from a friend to see if I'd like it (he never). I'll probably buy a better kit soon, but to say I'm still uncertain about what to buy is an understatement. And if I spend £100 I want to be as sure as I can be. I am techy also. 
20ckat*Why e-cigarette can be the most awesome thing ever and why they aren't yet.*deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4444  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/64944)
20ckat*Why e-cigarette can be the most awesome thing ever and why they aren't yet.*"I found the hardest part about getting people to vape instead of smoke is indeed the learning of new technologies, learning the jargon we use, and the maintenance. A cigarette doesn't leak. You can grab a pack almost anywhere. You dont have to worry about charging it. If a pack get stomped/wet you just drop another $5-$9. It is instant gratification at a moments notice. This is the reason I think most people have a harder time transitioning.

If someone get a disposable from a gas station and it doesnt last long or they grab an ego kit and it breaks in a week or two, they get put off. If they arn't informed that you have to replace the coil/clearo they think they just wasted money and go back to smoking.

Education is the hardest part and transition to something new is even harder. I am surprised at how many vape veterans there are since they had it pretty rough a few years back. I dont know if when I started, I would have gone to the lengths they did to vape."
20ckat*Why e-cigarette can be the most awesome thing ever and why they aren't yet.*"Also, I should ad two things :

1) It's only specific to Switzerland but here, juice with nicotine is illegal. It means you can only buy juice without nicotine in any store. If you want some, you can order online but again it makes it harder ! You have to plan how often you will order and how much you need. And if you don't have anymore juice, you can't just go to a shop and quickly buy a little bottle.

2) God knows how much I like my MVP, it really fits my need on an everyday vape. But again, why, when I want to know my battery status, I see 4.2V to 3.6V ? Yeah, I understand this, but my mother wouldn't at all ! Just show it with a percent !"

20ckat*Why e-cigarette can be the most awesome thing ever and why they aren't yet.*[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/927/)
20ckat*Why e-cigarette can be the most awesome thing ever and why they aren't yet.*"Agree…  I started with a shot-in-the-dark, how-complicated-could-it-be, almost impulse buy.  I was at a local tobacco shop, and asked the owner his opinion. He recommended a Blow One.  It was most unsatisfying,  The battery life was poor, the taste was unimpressive (though this could also have been a product of the juice I bought at the time), the airflow was severely lacking… I could have gotten just about as much out of sucking on a straw.  Rather than give up on the idea, I did some reading online and headed to the nearest vape shop. Now, armed with a Beyond Vape Spire, and Kanger Protank 3, I am far more satisfied, and replacing an ever increasing amount of my classic cigarette use with vaping.  But it should be easier for a newcomer to get something that’s going to satisfy.  The market needs something priced low enough to be carried at a local tobacco/liquor shop, but capable enough not to disappoint.

To be fair, I probably wouldn’t have (as many) complaints about the Blow One if I had started vaping as a non-smoker. A lot of my dissatisfaction came from comparing the experiences."
20ckat*Why e-cigarette can be the most awesome thing ever and why they aren't yet.*If it wasn't for my friend I would not have known where to start. It felt like starting a new hobby to me with so many different models, terminology, cleaning, picking juices, etc. Thanks to him I got an awesome set up (aerotank with evic) as my first ecig. Now I want to try and get my family members who are smokers to make the switch. 
20ckat*Why e-cigarette can be the most awesome thing ever and why they aren't yet.*"I recently started vaping, been a smoker for almost 20 years now. I stumbled upon a product called ""ploom"" which you can get for less than 30 Euros in any cigarette store here in Austria. In fact, the thing is manufactured and sold by JTI, one of the largest tobacco companies in the world and current holder of the Austrian tobacco license. 

They don't use liquids but tiny Nespresso-like pods filled with grained tobacco. The vaporizer itself is about as long as a middle finger and some, available in black or white. You charge it with a magnetic USB adapter. As said, the vaporizer with USB charger comes for 29,-, a pack with 12 pods for 5,-

The reason I impulsively went for it as soon as I noticed the display in the cig shop was, that you get those pods where you would get cigarettes, practically everywhere. Depending on the 'flavour', it is close to the real thing. The steam feels like smoke and you can puff. But of course, it doesn't stink nor turn anything yellow. It's also about three times cheaper than cigs, depending on your habit.

I haven't smoked a real cig since I have it. The thing looks somewhat stylish, is very light. The white version almost gives that « Apple » vibe you werte talking about. It's about as user friendly as it can get. Granted, you have a power source nearby.

Still deliberating about trying liquids. But there are too many options online to decide where to go. It seems as if everybody and their mothers are dabbling with selling those vaporizers now. Any recommendations are appreciated.

If you want a quick, cheap and somewhat stylish vaporizer with widely available fills I can recommend that Ploom stuff. It also successfully vaporizes marihuana, but you'll might want to get the fermented stuff, which is harder to come by and harder to make than the regular dry greenie.

20ckat*Why e-cigarette can be the most awesome thing ever and why they aren't yet.*I think i may know a concept that could potentially be a sollution. Lets say we have a metal battery that is about the size of an 18650, but they could also have alternative sizes depending on how big you wanted it to be but for the sake of this post lets say 18650 is top of the line size. on that there is a small button similar to that of an ego twist that is easily accessible/ not on the bottom like most mech mods now a days. Then on the bottom is a similar twist to change the voltage to make it hit harder like an ego except on each turn it locks in to an extent so it isnt between voltages/you know exactly what it is. then with the tank there is twistable airflow to get harder hits off depending on how much you would like to inhale. The company could then sell liquid attached to the drip tip that heats up inside the twistable airflow, except the whole drip tip/liquid carton combo is disposable so whenever you run out or want to replace the flavor you just pull it out and put the other one in so the battery and tank is together and you dont have too many moving parts. With that you could also buy wider or skinnier drip tips to get the proper pull you would like. finally to charge it all you would have to do is pop a cap up on the bottom and plug it in. Voila ultimate sollution and my guess is the whole combo itself wouldnt cost more than $50 or $60 to get a nice, non moving starting kit.
20ckat*Why e-cigarette can be the most awesome thing ever and why they aren't yet.*"Well written post.  I just switched to vaping after 20 + years of smoking.  I did some research and thought I was way ahead of most beginners by getting a Halo Triton starter kit.  Then I started looking into it more and realize I could have done better.  However, when I started I would not have been able to wrap my head around a box looking mod like a MVP2.

The maintenance and variation of maintenance between tanks etc... is quite confusing.  Some juice cracks plastic tanks how do you know which? How do you know when to change coils? All of these things are confusing to novices and there is almost too much info (if that is possible) out there.   

I am still not sure what I should upgrade to.  I just know I'd like a better product.  An MVP2 or a Provari.  The drip mods/mechs look too confusing to me."

Also, sometimes you just crave the flavour of a real cigarette. Most of the tobacco flavours I've tried tend to be pretty weak, so I've gravitated more towards the cigar end of the spectrum just to find something that gets close. However, for me at least, it's been enough to keep me off the cancer sticks. I sometimes also treat myself to a disposable electronic cigar just to have a change.

The horse has already gotten out of the barn with the term e-cigarettes.  Changing or dropping that term would be impossible at this point and would make practically no difference.  In fact, I say it would actually make things worse because it would be construed to say that the vaping community is trying to mislead the public.

I don't care for the term e-cig, and I purposely choose not to use it when I talk about my vaping hobby with friends.  I don't use e-cigs, I use a ""mod"" or ""personal vaporizer"" or whatever term makes the most sense to whoever I'm talking to. 

The ""stigma"" really has nothing to do with the name.  The stigma results from 20+ years of regulatory and public obsession with destroying the tobacco industry.  Vaping, unfortunately, is inextricably linked with tobacco because of the nicotine."

1fxokl*On VaporJoes, FastTech, Innokin.*"Your link to the ""android based device"" is not a rip off. It's just a cheap ass device (not android based) with emulators on it. 

They don't try to sell it as a PSP or PS Vita or even a Nintendo product.

I don't see a problem with that. 

Other than that, I completely agree with you. I have nothing against affiliate links, but the fact that they are affiliate links shouldn't be a secret."
1fxokl*On VaporJoes, FastTech, Innokin.*"Regarding the fasttech/innokin debate: 

Read Innokins statements very clearly, they 'can only assume' because they do not have Fasttech listed as a customer that has ordered. 

it's highly unlikely that fasttech is ordering from Innokin AS Fasttech. There's a very good chance that Fasttech is actually selling Innokin products, based on some of my personal research the prices they're charging match up with their pricing model and what they most likely paid for the Innokin products on their site. 

Innokin ""price fixes"" so do a LOT of the other big names. Guess who else does? The majority of the US manufacturers of products... guess why? So the business stays healthy. It's not price fixing, it's MSRP and it protects the market. 

When the MSRP mark up is too high or too low I take offense as a vendor and as a consumer. Innokins is one of the less offensive price models I've run into. 

Fasttech is 'why' suppliers have an MSRP. with fasttechs business model, no other store out there could possibly keep up and it would drive profit margins down to a point that for some one like me to sell those products to you, I would have to 'lose' money on transactions. 

People get uppity about 100 or 120% mark ups on chinese products because they get on alibaba and find out how much that ego twist costs per unit. 

Let's create a fake item with a round number, I'll call it an Bog. The bog costs 'me' 10 bucks. 

1. I have to buy 100 of them so I have to invest at least 1000 dollars into the product. Sounds round but at the end of the day, every dollar sitting on a shelf is a dollar 'not' making me more money somewhere else. Same as a dollar sitting in a checking account. So a 1000 stock investment is 1000 dollars sitting flat. 

2. I have to pay shipping to get Bogs from china, because of long lead times and product cycles I need to ship fast, I can't afford to wait on the 'cheap' shipping. That means I'm going to pay between 5% total cost and 15% total cost of the inventory to ship, more withs ome products because batteries are heavy :p I'm being very 'nice' in my estimate there. So 1000 dollar order turned into a 1150 order.

3. I've gotta get money over there.. they only take paypal or wire transfer. At a 1000 dollar 'cost' I'm looking at about 40 bucks  (rounding down) with either method of payment so now we're up to 1190 to get 100 Bogs to my door which puts the cost of the Bog to me at 11.9$.


Now, You saw 10 bucks on Alibaba for Bogs and I'm already paying 11.90 so I'm already almost 20% over the 'cost' you saw. Those that run or participate in Co-ops are familiar with this amount of fluff being added.... but now lets look at 'just' the costs associated with me selling YOU that bog...

So I've got a 10 dollar unit that already cost me 11.90 to get into my shop and now i have to determine what I'm going to charge for it, what my mark up will be. I'll go with an 'easy' 100% (I personally have a formula I use for different product types based on how much complexity is involved, whether or not it's consumable, and whether or not it's likely to need to be replaced due to failure). 

So I'm up to 23.80 for the item YOU saw on Alibaba for 10 bucks. 

When I sell you that 23.80 item I will pay approximately 1.50 to my CC process/bank/whatever just to 'take' your money for me and give it to me. So that brings us down to 22.30. I will spend between 1 and 1.5 on shipping materials, labels, ink, paper, etc which takes us down to about 20.8. 

Now we remove the cost of the item to me itself, which was 11.9 and you've got 8.9. Lets assume there was absolutely NO other costs associated with running my business for a second. I take that 8.9 and stick it in my bank account... oops, uncle sam has to get his cut too which is ~30% for me so that leaves me with around 6.23 in the bank after selling an item marked up 100% I end up with around 50% of the initial cost of the item in my bank account. 

And guess what... those aren't even 'close' to the total sum of costs that I have to pay, those are just 'some' of the single transaction related costs. 


Businesses who've been around a while or who have done their research and math before hand know that the mark up might seem huge but the take on it is a lot smaller. Consumers... they rarely understand this and will say things like ""Well, how does fasttech get their prices so low then, you shoudl just drop down to compete"" 

They get their prices down by ordering massive quantities and negotiating a lower price, they don't pay huge shipping costs to get from china to the US (they ship slow and cheap and lie on customs forms), they don't have to deal with processing fees,  you pay those processing fees. The overhead for doing what they do is much lower. Innokin 'could' sell the MVPs one at a time to you, the consumer... but they support the business model of being a 'supplier' and not a vendor so they sell to vendors for resale and put an MSRP on there that makes sense. 

Some suppliers have stupid MSRPs that are too high, innokin is not one of them. "
1fxokl*On VaporJoes, FastTech, Innokin.*"I've been PMed multiple times to 'weigh in' on the Vaporjoes part and how I feel about what he does for the community. 

here are my thoughts: He's popular, he runs a rather large organization of vapers, and he posts deals. Beyond that, I don't care. He's a beneficial force for the consumer, if he makes a lil money on it... I don't care. The ""is he lieing"" or whatever... I also don't care. He doesn't try to 'sell' products, he posts deals for what they are, low priced deals. If he was pushing specific things because he makes money on them as opposed to actually posting the best deals he can find, I would start to take offense. 

In my experience, he's not doing that. He did defend fast tech and sorta bash innokin and that might have had a little 'self interest' in there, but in his defense, nothing he said was ""untrue"" to my knowledge and fasttech, while a bane to my personal existance, is basically the walmart of chinese vaporizers right now and that's not ""bad"" for the consumer yet. 

The jury is out on whether or not it will prove to be bad in the long run. It's deffinitely bad for mom and pop shops like myself and the majority of other ecig vendors in the US. Hopefully this whole thing lights a fire under the collective asses of the US market to get out there and start making some high quality US made alternatives to the chinese stuff. 
"
1fxokl*On VaporJoes, FastTech, Innokin.*"This has all been explained before.

Vaporjoe gets money from EVERY link from his blog, not just FastTech.

The person who received the laser pointer is ONE person not getting an MVP, which was what they ordered. 

Thirdly, it has been explained before on this forum that FastTech most likely has a front company that buys MVPs from Innokin so they can sell them on their site for a small profit, instead of a huge profit.

Yes, the MVPs from FastTech are genuine, and so are the SVDs.  Innokins statement that FastTech is selling fakes is just to make people afraid to buy them."
1fxokl*On VaporJoes, FastTech, Innokin.*This is gonna sound snotty but I don't mean for it to be. Have you actually ordered anything from fasttech? The panasonics cgr ch's are the best batteries I've used so far....no issues whatsover. I haven't had an issue with any of the other products either. I know that guy got a laser but from what I understand it was just a mistake on their part and are refunding/exchanging it.....I'm curious as to whether or not any other people have gotten any of the innokin products from them.
1fxokl*On VaporJoes, FastTech, Innokin.*"I understand and agree with the stuff about vaporjoe.  I agree that he should be able to monetize, but I do not like dishonesty/manipulation.

But all this Innokin stuff is just a lot of he-said-she-said speculation.  Obviously fasttech *could* be selling knockoff MVPs.  Obviously fasttech *could* be buying under a different name and selling actual Innokin-made MVPs.  Obviously Innokin wants you to think fasttech's MVPs are knockoffs because they don't want you to buy them.  Obviously fasttech wants you to think their MVPs are made by Innokin because they do want you to buy them.

Surely there is someone out there that has an MVP from an authorized dealer and an MVP from fasttech that can disassemble them and see whether they're knockoffs or not.

If not, and we really want to know the truth and end all this speculative arguing, we could organize a group pool and a respected, knowledgeable, neutral member of our community could then use the pool to order one MVP from an authorized dealer, one from fasttech, and compare.  /r/themonkeysbeard maybe?  A few dollars each from 20-50 people and we'll know for sure.  I'll throw in $10.

Edit: 

> My opinion is that I like doing business with people who are honest

I'm curious, Evil_This.  If it turns out fasttech's MVPs are actually Innokin made, would you stop doing business with/no longer respect Innokin for leading everyone to believe that fasttech's MVPs are fake?

1fxokl*On VaporJoes, FastTech, Innokin.*"Of course he's making money off affiliate links and affiliate coupons, I don't see a problem with it. It is also kinda shitty he won't admit to it, I see a problem with that.

People line up in droves for coops selling knockoff mods and they can be a PITA. I like FastTech, their site doesn't look like shit and they ship quickly. A lot of the terribly run vendors stateside are throwing a fit about their profits but I don't care, I'll go wherever is cheapest. 

I bought a FastTech MVP for my dad, it works perfectly fine. I also bought some Vivi Novas off FastTech and they were shit. FastTech actually refunded my money and told me to keep them. Never had service like that stateside aside from a few juice vendors. "

The TENOFF code was initially announced in an affiliate newsletter, and later it appeared on some 

forums and affiliate banners.

It was scheduled to be expired in March, 2013 but it stayed valid for almost 2 extra months. 

Coupons are usually allowed to run overtime (a grace period) to give last minute customers enough 

time to make up their minds and complete the checkout process. Two months grace may be an 

overkill for this purpose though.

The CPASTE13SPRING coupon is also an affiliate coupon that was created in partnership with an 

affiliate. It is meant for the ""spring"" season only and thus it is also running in grace period 

now.

We'll update here when an exact expiry date is set for the CPASTE13SPRING code.

Thank you."
1fxokl*On VaporJoes, FastTech, Innokin.*I always assumed Vaperjoe was for profit, as long as he is honestly posting the best deal he can find(/get) I'm not worried. But if he doesn't post something to make money or posts a bad deal (for money) then he should thrown under the bus. 
1fxokl*On VaporJoes, FastTech, Innokin.*I don't like VaporJoe, never have. He always gave me a bad vibe, but I do have to say that the Nitecore i4 charger that I got from Fasttech was legit. It is identical to the one I got from my local B&M and also identical to the one I bought from Amazon. That is the only item I've bought from Fasttech.

Still, our parliament showed some common sense, and I keep my fingers crossed for the US to do the same. 
I've been cigarette-free for almost a year now thanx to vaping, and I lowered my nic intake from 24mg/ml to 8mg/ml. Without any problems whatsoever. 
I hope US does the right thing, I hope the FDA does as they preach and finally accept that vaping is the best, easiest and most healthy way to stop smoking there is. Of course, it wouldn't hurt that people deciding were smokers-vapers themselves, instead of blindly saying ""that's bad, that's good, you should quit"". You can't know that if you haven't been there, it's impossible. As a man can never understand the kind of pain a childbirth provides, no matter how good a description was, so a non-smoker can necer understand how hard it is to quit and never start again. 

Again, fellow vapers, my fingers are crossed for some common sense in FDA. Here's a cloud for y'all!

1gxei6*My review - The Vapor Chef juices. (Wall o' Text).*"Great post!!  Here's your TL;DR:  A good post-coital-vape is  Apple Bourbon Tobacco!  lol

Since you like tobacco juices, try the Honey Nut Tobacco.  Vape it fresh, it is yummy.  Steep it for 3 weeks, it'll blow your mind.  It get mine at 12mg & 50/50.

1gxei6*My review - The Vapor Chef juices. (Wall o' Text).*"Agreed, hard, on the Apple Bourbon Tobacco and the Black Pom - I was only lukewarm on Black Pom the first time I got it. So when it showed up as a freebie in a later order I just kind of shrugged and threw it in the back of my juice bin for a rainy day. A few weeks later, I tried it, and holy FUCK. Just like you described - nubile. So very, very juicy, without being cloying. And, like many of Chef's juices - it just tastes *true*. 

ABT is my hoarding juice, though. So delicious and sexy."

1gxei6*My review - The Vapor Chef juices. (Wall o' Text).*While we're talking TVC, though - I just have to say, I can't seem to make sense of any S'mores flavors. Granted, I've only had TVC and MBV. But still, I can't manage to pick out any of the ingredients of a s'mores in there. Not necessarily the fault of the juice-makers, it's more like my tongue can't communicate the flavors to my brain. Anyone else have this problem?

1gxei6*My review - The Vapor Chef juices. (Wall o' Text).*"A super thorough review - thank you for this! I've tasted a few of these, and love the Vapor Chef. I didn't know this sub was even here. Subscribed!

I'm glad to hear that peppermint pattie has mellowed. Right now mine is pretty strong, and if it were to stay this way I would add it to other flavors like I do Absolute 0  (which I add to practically everything - love the stuff).

I really liked frosty strawberry. I liked frosty peach too, but not as much as the strawberry. Frosty peach was a pleasant surprise because most peach flavored juice tastes like peach schnapps (YUCK!) and this did not. 

Coocumber Melon: Holy cow, In my order this morning I ordered two of the ""big"" bottles, and coolcumber melon was one of them. I can't believe how quickly I went through the small bottle of this one. A definite ADV for me - just cool, lightly sweet yumminess!

I got black pom pom a couple of months ago and am still waiting to like it. It's pretty strong, but probably just not my flavor. Might be very good mixed with another fruity vape with a couple drops of Absolute 0.

I'm not a compulsive shopper, but the Vapor Chef's juices are so good that I could probably go broke ordering all of the juices I like from him."

1gxei6*My review - The Vapor Chef juices. (Wall o' Text).*Great review! I want to try many because of your feedback. What type of tank/e-cig are you using? Do you think this effects the flavor? Thanks for taking the time to write so much I'm saving this!

2l6ewg*Why Do E-Cigarette Bans Exist? | VapeRev*Well as a pharmacist, I am acutely aware of the actions of nicotine as well as the ineffectiveness of the cessation aids. There are positive benefits ascribed to nicotine and while being described as one of the most addictive substances to man, it is almost impossible to show any inclination to self administer by laboratory animal models. I also am well aware of the actions the FDA has taken in the past and they seem to be rather aloof when presented with facts by MD's, Drug Companies, patients, pharmacists and the general population. I have personally taken action to secure adequate supplies of gear, should any unfavorablel decision transpire. At least, I know the prices will not get any lower. In the worst possible case scenario, the FDA could drive this industry underground, but I feel the momentum cannot be stopped. The answer is coming soon. The FDA are known badasses. I'm ready to grown my own tobacco and extract my own nicotine if neccesary.
2l6ewg*Why Do E-Cigarette Bans Exist? | VapeRev*"I disagree with the premise of the article, this idea that e-cig bans exist for the benefit of big tobacco. The thing that struck me during the big California debate on e-cig regulation (the first state to regulate them iirc), the argument for regulation basically boiled down to ""it's a tobacco product and therefor we need to regulate it"". The question about whether it is the government's job to regulate these products in the first place is entirely lost on these people. It's about control, pure and simple. "
2l6ewg*Why Do E-Cigarette Bans Exist? | VapeRev*I understand why in America they would want to ban it (high tobacco taxes, no free healthcare), but in places like the UK, wouldn't they want people to vape? Because even with the loss in tax revenue, surely it will save the healthcare system more money than what they will lose by like ten folds (made that figure up, could be more or could be less).
2l6ewg*Why Do E-Cigarette Bans Exist? | VapeRev*Big tobacco rules the industry. Paying the industry to market vapes as just as harmful when it has been proved time and time again that it is healthier and a great method to quitting smoking. Money rules the world. It's a shame but we have to take the fight to them. A smoke-free 2030 is coming!

1pqizx*Why vaping is so important to me.*This is the kind of story that needs to be put in front of regulatory authorities.
1pqizx*Why vaping is so important to me.*I had quit smoking numerous times. Sometimes for up to a year. But I always fell back to it. I swore I'd quit when my kids (twins) were born, but they were born very premature and I can not begin to express how stressful that was. So once they got out of the NICU after months I quit, with the help of some cheap 510 style crappy ecigs, but they helped. This was years ago before the wealth of vaping options were available. With my kids as my drive I quit and stayed away from cigarrettes for over a year. But as most who have quit atleast once it was nothing but cravings which slowly slowed but were always there when triggers hit (driving, after meals, stress, so on). Then one day I found out about mods, and gave it a try. My wife was furious thinking vaping was just a way of smoking without saying I smoked. I kept with it, learned slow and the hard way. Eventually she listened to my rhetoric and began to understand what it was. Now here I am, my kids almost 5 years old, and I havn't had but maybe 2 cigarettes since I started vaping. I admit a few smokes because of very hard times when I just needed that old comfort to deal with death of family or other hard times. But I love vaping, I still have my old lavatube that I started with. Keep that old POS as a reminder of where it all started. There's still a good chance that cancer will be my end with my rich family history of it, but I'll be damned if it'll be of my own doing. 
1pqizx*Why vaping is so important to me.*"My fiance and I just bought our first house 2 months ago. It was a foreclosure and we got a great deal. Only problem was the previous owners must of smoked like chimneys. 

We started cleaning the house and I was amazed at the damage the cigarette smoke did. Everything in the house was covered in a film of smoke. You could actually feel it on the windows and walls. We had to wash the walls twice before even trying to paint...It was really disgusting. While cleaning the water would run down the wall and it would look like they were bleeding a dark smelly brown liquid. 

Now I smoked a pack a day+ for the past 15 years and had really no intentions on quitting but after dealing with washing a whole house from top to bottom and replacing all the carpeting I decided there would be no smoking in our house. 

I bought an Ego twist last week and fell in love. I havent had a cigarette in 4 days. [As you can see](http://i.imgur.com/Z7YNHVD.jpg) I dove right in and I am not looking back. "

1qv8n9*First Day Without a Real Cigarette!*"I had the exact same thing happen in July. Keep vaping. It's not *nearly* as tough as quitting cold turkey, just have to remember you're still getting the nicotine with vaping, which is the part your brain wants. The zippo lighter, the ashing, the particular way you snuff a cigarette when you're done, all of those things are preferences that break like very tiny twigs and you won't miss them. Especially won't miss running outside in the cold/rain to get a nic fix (hopefully this part lasts).

The number one thing that got me switching to vaping is that I didn't know how long to vape. I was so used to knowing how long it took to smoke a cigarette that my brain tried to reason it out the same way. So, the most helpful advice I could ever give you is that in no way or form should you compare vaping to smoking. You can vape all you want, don't try to make it ""session based"" like analogs.

Keep going though, you won't regret it!"
1qv8n9*First Day Without a Real Cigarette!*"Cool ... now, just keep vaping.  As I tried different flavors, I found myself vaping more and going out for cigarettes far less.  My brother in law and I would frequently chat outside when we would both go for cigarettes at the same time (I lived next door to my sister and her husband for a while and he and I both worked from home), and after a while, he thought that I had moved out because I was never outside smoking anymore.  Then, one day while hanging out at a friends bar, I realized that I greatly preferred vaping.

It's a process, and that was just my experience, but keep it up!"
1qv8n9*First Day Without a Real Cigarette!*I started vaping in February after smoking 1-1.5 pack of Camel filters a day and I haven't had a smoke since, my mom smoked about 3 packs a day and she hasn't had a smoke in about 4 months since she started vaping. Good luck and happy vaping.

I really want e-cigs to be acceptable in the public's eyes, but this can't get any traction if the only people funding research are the people for it, and against it. There are politics in science, too. 

I just saw a Cosmos episode the other day that talked a bit about how the petroleum industry hired a scientist to do research to prove that lead based gasoline and paint was harmless, but that got debunked so hard, people scoff at the idea in modern society. 

Not saying e-cigs are bad, I believe that they are perfectly fine, but biased research is going to do absolutely nothing but make us look like buffoons as we wave it around in other people's faces.

It's shitty that the city decided to enforce this zoning four days before the new year, but it's not like those shops didn't know there was a risk of this happening - they just chose to gamble and this time they lost."

1lpy0i*Dear Newer Vapers - if your clearos look like those on the right, stop using them.*This has only happened to tanks I've used licorice-y flavors in. Can we get some empirical data or even a solid educated guess as to why you are recommending against using them once they've fogged up?
1lpy0i*Dear Newer Vapers - if your clearos look like those on the right, stop using them.*Thanks. Good info to have. I just ordered a couple of kits from steam monkey and I was a bit worried about what I could use in them without messing up the tanks that it comes with.

I got my EVOD starter kit 3 weeks ago and I haven't looked back since, and I already feel way, way better.

Dismantle all your vape gear and take as much juice as possible, I believe it's 3oz. All vape gear should go into a separate bag and each battery should be in its own separate bag.

1rn0lq*9 Terribly Disturbing Things About E-Cigarettes: A Reaction Video*I think we have covered the fact that some people choose to be stupid.
1rn0lq*9 Terribly Disturbing Things About E-Cigarettes: A Reaction Video*I'm so thankful that this point-by-point, coherent response was made to what seems to me to be a biased article. There are literally BILLIONS of dollars at stake for the big tobacco companies if vaping takes off and tanks their stock. I understand that. What I don't understand is why don't we fight fire with fire? We in the vaping community can come together with our positive reviews and TRUE data to refute their smear campaign. I know that personally, I am a success story because of vaping. I had tried it all (patch, lozenge, gum, zyban) to no avail. I am one month cigarette-free because of these devices. If nothing else, I will forward all of this to my friends and family.
1rn0lq*9 Terribly Disturbing Things About E-Cigarettes: A Reaction Video*It's clear that vaporizers are nowhere near as dangerous as cigarettes. Any rational society would be handing them out for free at hospitals.
1rn0lq*9 Terribly Disturbing Things About E-Cigarettes: A Reaction Video*"I think the fact that it is so much less harmful than cigarettes, and helps people kick smoking, is the really important thing here. It is so well known that *smoking will kill you*, I get frustrated that people are attacking e-cigarettes. Maybe we don't have the library of literature behind vaping like we do with cigarette smoke, but it is like saying smoking pot is a bad alternative to shooting yourself in the head. We don't know *everything* bad about pot, but for fucks sake it's probably better than a bullet to the head.

I feel much better about smoking e-cigarettes than newports, and my lungs feel the same way ever morning I wake up and I can BREATH. I have a feeling there is some serious tobacco industry influence going on. Thanks for your post, god bless DeawthsMeow."

I hope she delivers since I have already paid. Another senior member assured me that anna mae will deliver so I have no reason to doubt it.

I think the biggest reason for all the craziness is the profit margins on the hardware is great for the store. However, when consumers see wholesale pricing they realize how much they are overpaying and learn a certain degree of patience leading them to flock to co-ops and group buys. So what if the host makes a buck or two off each participant. They deserve it for putting up with adds, deletions, PMs, accounting, mailing, etc. However, that buck or two off each participant is leading to the corruption of the organizations.

The only way for any manufacturer to truly control pricing is to sell direct or through select vendors like Provape, Golden Greek, and REOmods all of which have a strong following, a great product."

2dme7h*Look at what arrived in the mail this morning.. Can't wait to try it out!*I absolutely love my nautilus. The only complaint is you have to wash the entire thing out with soap and change the head when you want to switch flavors. And even after that you're going to get remnants of the passed flavlr. Do not use mint/menthol or you will taste it forever with that tank! Other than that I like mine a lot.

Unless you're running a vape shop, there's no reason you should be making money. 

So, buy away! Because the more we buy, the more we save!"
22lm0n*Official /r/E_Cigarette Kayfun Lite Plus Clone Co-Op*Woohoo, another co-op! I am only after one of the colours, is it possible to order just one? The order sheet is asking me to order an amount from all three colour types.
22lm0n*Official /r/E_Cigarette Kayfun Lite Plus Clone Co-Op*"Hope I'm not asking a dumb question. I know it specifically says, ""If you can't pay when you sign up, do NOT sign up,"" but we pay after you've taken a look at the whole buy, right?

Sorry, I haven't done a group buy here. The other buys I've done require immediate payment."
22lm0n*Official /r/E_Cigarette Kayfun Lite Plus Clone Co-Op*I'm definitely interested in this co-op.  I may wait a couple days to see how many orders get placed for the color I want before signing up though.
22lm0n*Official /r/E_Cigarette Kayfun Lite Plus Clone Co-Op*"Do you know if these have the logo and the ""Made in Germany"" engraving? I'm in if they don't.

**Edit:** Whoops, just spotted the edit at the bottom of the post addressing this question, sorry. I'll watch for updates."
22lm0n*Official /r/E_Cigarette Kayfun Lite Plus Clone Co-Op*OK, I have a question. I want to get two, and am mildly interested in having one of them in black, but I'm more interested in the group buy making the MOQs. Is there a way to put in my order for one SS and one black but make it clear that I'm very willing to switch to both being SS if it helps make this actually go through? (I'm guessing that the SS will be the most popular)
22lm0n*Official /r/E_Cigarette Kayfun Lite Plus Clone Co-Op*Is this still a thing that is happening? :x
22lm0n*Official /r/E_Cigarette Kayfun Lite Plus Clone Co-Op*I'm in

22lm0n*Official /r/E_Cigarette Kayfun Lite Plus Clone Co-Op*"A few things. 

What company are you buying them from? 

Did you know that you can ship these in a small padded envelope for 2-3 dollars. Much cheaper. 

Did you also know that there are Kay Fun Light Pluses from Tobeco with extra colored tanks on eBay. I know the all black and gold are cool but I know of a couple great vendors on EBay that offer free shipping on the SS KFL+ with extra tank for 37.99. "
22lm0n*Official /r/E_Cigarette Kayfun Lite Plus Clone Co-Op*"Spread the word people!!!

I know there's significant enough interest in Kafun clones that we should be hitting top-tier price breaks!"
22lm0n*Official /r/E_Cigarette Kayfun Lite Plus Clone Co-Op*"if we get more than one, does the price per get any cheaper?
also, when is the expected delivery on this?"

1f3qmj*Data collecting on various ecig subs*"That's the way it is.  ECR is the largest e-cig sub and, because of that, shows up first in any sort of search in Google or Reddit. When people go looking for such sub, of course they're going to head to the larger one because it's got the most content flowing in.

Of course, the longer they stay, the more likely they are to see the practices and beliefs in place....."
1f3qmj*Data collecting on various ecig subs*"Oh, I know you. You - with your ""facts"" and ""logic"" trying to turn normal Internet discussions into useful dialog.

I, for one, won't put up with it! Not on MY watch, pal."
1f3qmj*Data collecting on various ecig subs*I supported the Daily Vape Pics thread fully.  IMO, as the sub grew, the easily digestible content and repetitive questions were going to completely take over(it already was).  His intention was to keep ecr from turning into that.  He went about it completely wrongly though.   The sidebar is also a mess.  The wiki isn't going to work and the guide system is much better for our purposes.  I will still visit and post in ecr, but I've lost a lot of respect for the mods and many users.  The way some people, on both sides handled that situation was ridiculous.  I appreciate this subs open policy, however as it grows you'll encounter the same issues of imgur links dominating the front page and detailed guides and reviews being ignored.  I'm here to help and will even write guides for the sidebar if wanted. 
1f3qmj*Data collecting on various ecig subs*/r/Vaping also exists with over 400 posts, however most of them seem to be by one user u/KateVapersnet.
1f3qmj*Data collecting on various ecig subs*"It's times like this that I wish that [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) was ready for the general public to set up sites. I love reddit, and have found some great subs that have literally changed my life but I feel like every big sub I've been a part of has experienced this same issue over the last year. Once it reaches critical mass the content becomes harder to sort through, and from what I've seen Discourse should help solve those issues.

EDIT: It looks like I might be able to set something up, but it is still beta software and I'm not sure if the need/interest would be high enough for yet another ecig forum to justify getting something up and running.

Only time will tell I guess."
1f3qmj*Data collecting on various ecig subs*"WOW... How much angst can you (not the OP personally, more a rhetorical question) cram into one thread!?

Personal perspective from an uninvolved individual:

With a topic as broad and popular as vaping multiple (promoted) subs dedicated to specific topics are a MUST!

Valuable info is too easily lost in a fast moving sub. When I first started researching this stuff MY first stop was ECR, I browsed, looked at a few threads, none of which made much sense because I could see little that I initially understood.

Then went looking for a noob sub and found /r/Vaping101 where I asked a question and got the answers I needed.

My point is that the thread rate (how quickly threads are posted) in ECR is too high for it to be anything but a general discussion area.

And finally a question for /u/smallchanger : Why the angst and attitude? Why not accept that the sub has grown to the point that topic specific subs are now necessary?"
1f3qmj*Data collecting on various ecig subs*Would it be too meta to have a /r/vaporjerk?
1f3qmj*Data collecting on various ecig subs*We all knew the argument was completely invalid, but I for one salute you for factually proving it.
1f3qmj*Data collecting on various ecig subs*"That peckerhead probably has no subfolders on his hard drive, as they leech content from his c:\ root folder.

Cheers to you slumber, we need MORE differentiation so we can foster more meaningful, focused discussion. "
1f3qmj*Data collecting on various ecig subs*"I've been doing some data collecting and here's some statistics I've made for you too slumberland.

* On ECR You have made 90 submissions in 7 months since you created r/rba.   
30 of those are you promoting it.   
That's 33% of your posts are you promoting r/rba

* You have made 65 posts on ECR since you announced that you were thinking of selling rba supplies.  
15 out of those 65 posts are you promoting your business. That's 23%

* 2 months ago you made a post advertising r/slumberland - ""A place to get spammed by me (so i don't do it here anymore)"".  
Since then you have made 11 submissions.  
8 of these submissions are you promoting your business. That's 72%.


I mention all this because I want to ask you, what do you think the purpose of ECR is.  
Do you think content relating to rebuildable atomizers, the largest area of development in ecigs should be posted there?

I ask that because 4 months ago when you announced r/steamheads having created r/rba a few months previously [you said](/r/SteamHeads/comments/15szbf/welcome_to_steamheads/c7pu880) ecr had fewer things which interested you and that was also the case for 75% of the people you talked to which is why you felt r/steamheads was necessary. You said if your ""noble experiment"" pans out you'll just spend less time on new user posts in ECR, and on ECR in general, if it comes to it, and stay in r/RBA where nearly every post is still something that fascinates and interests you.

Because it's all very well you listing off stats you had a program create but the program didn't inform you of the nature of the content your subreddits drain. If you are draining away content which deals with the largest are of development in ecigs, then what becomes of the subreddit?

Do you know of any other subreddit where a supplier created additional splinter subreddits to separate out content which deals with the development of that hobby with a consequence where the original subreddit is left as a beginner's support forum?

You show a clear disdain for ECR. In this thread you mock my efforts and creating a FAQ and wiki which is work I have done to limit the frequency of beginner type questions in order to foster a community and to curtail the kind of content you criticize. You never helped. Yet here you are in this thread offering your FAQ writing services and making friends with a subreddit which wants to enable the kind of content you criticized ECR for having. Funny that, isn't it.

You said that ECR doesn't interest you yet you have no shame using the subreddit to promote your business and your subreddits. You think it is my job to kowtow to your self-interests and your desires. If you want to drain the subreddit of the content you like, you think it is my job and the subreddit's to fullfill that desire. Can I ask you how many more splinter subreddits do you intend to produce? I came accross /r/mechmods recently. Is that another of your endevours? "

2d72jq*A big thumbs up to the Vapor Chef guys*"Yep, I've made several orders from /u/TheVaporChef, and every single one of them has come with a freebie bottle, an army man, and a hand-written ""thanks"" of some sort.

My favorite was when my e-cig secret Santa asked them to write ""Merry Christmas"" or something on the packing slip, and instead I got [this specially labeled bottle of Hobbes' Blood](http://i.imgur.com/NCnSrQC.jpg). It was pretty cool."
2d72jq*A big thumbs up to the Vapor Chef guys*Thanks!
2d72jq*A big thumbs up to the Vapor Chef guys*My favorite part is the Douglas Adams quote on their invoice.
2d72jq*A big thumbs up to the Vapor Chef guys*"Yep. Just another fanboy checking in. Vapor Chef has never disappointed me in any way. Their products and their service are both outstanding. 

Another thing to consider is the issue of trust. Every time I see one of those news articles that uses the phrase, ""It's the Wild West out there in terms of juice production.""...which gets said way too much in my opinion...I think to myself...no, no, it's not. I'm buying my juice from a professional operation that takes pride in manufacturing a safe, consistent product to the requested specifications. The Chef has posted pics of his set-up, and it's better organized and cleaner than the kitchens of most places you eat at everyday. Also I know he and his crew are sending me the same product that they use themselves. I'm comfortable vaping their juice in a way that I wasn't when I ordered from some other vendors.

They are also working hard at the political level to fight against the pending regulations, and I think that's worthy of supporting."
2d72jq*A big thumbs up to the Vapor Chef guys*"They get a lot of praise around here but for good reason.  From what I see, they're just a perfect case-study in what I want from a company I deal with.

The product is great

The packaging is great

They're engaging with customers and in public forums

They're advocating for customers politically

They're relatively transparent about their operations, both on the business side and with their mixing

Their staff seems to be happy and treated well

Really, I don't think I've interacted with a business in any industry that I hold in higher regard.  I don't order juice too much since I've started DIY but I recommend the hell out of these guys."
2d72jq*A big thumbs up to the Vapor Chef guys*I stopped ordering from anywhere else after finding them.  I used to brew my own but they are, by far, my superior at flavor.  I combine honey pearry and kerry's berries in one aero.  In another I combine bloody mango and hobbes blood.  Those four flavors have been all I've wanted for the last 6 months.  
2d72jq*A big thumbs up to the Vapor Chef guys*Vapor Chef is one of my favorites and are makers of my two favorite juices. Cloud Custard and Honey Pearry at 6mg of nic are my two all-day vapes. They're always my first recommendation.

29ok2q*Why not to support Big Tobacco E-Cig options*"Another reason - It is in big tobacco's interest to eliminate all but cig-alikes. That way they control the market.

It will be a different vaping world if e-juice, tanks, batteries, etc are deemed illegal by the FDA. Only the big companies get to play in that environment."

1vwbtr*Newbie and stoked! Wanted to just share my story*"Good luck to you. 

I'm approaching three weeks without a cigarette. If you catch the bug like I have, just get a calculator and figure out how much you would spend on smokes this year and realize how much you're not spending."
1vwbtr*Newbie and stoked! Wanted to just share my story*"Rock on!  Just remember a few things:

1. Vaping doesn't taste like smoking.  Nothing tastes exactly like smoking.  That's disappointing to some people initially, but after a short while, you'll be glad it doesn't.  Smoke tastes horrible, and vaping tastes like whatever you want it to.  If you're not fully committed to vaping after the first few drags, keep it up.  Don't try to replicate the taste of your smoke -- try to replace it with something MUCH better :)

2. If you gotta have a smoke, go for it.  Don't beat yourself up over it.  When I started vaping, I cut back from a pack a day to 5 or so a week (usually when drinking), but kept telling myself ""This cigarette isn't a failure, it's just one cigarette.  No big deal.  I smoked 20 a day, I can have 1 or 3 and I'm still ahead of where I was, and in the future I'll smoke less"".  This isn't the best plan, but it's better than the old plan where I picked up a cig and instantly thought ""well, I failed.  back to smoking"" :(

3. HYDRATE!  Drink plenty of water.  Cigarettes will dehydrate you a bit, and you should already have been drinking water, but vaping dehydrates you more.  Make sure you drink plenty of liquids (or preferably straight-up water if possible).

Not sure if it's necessary, but hey, that's my contribution.  Hope I'm helping :)"
1vwbtr*Newbie and stoked! Wanted to just share my story*Congrats! I assure you, the Evod kit you will get will smoke (pun intended) your Blu. I am 15 months strong without a cigarette because of e-cigs. If you have any questions about your kit, just let me know!
1u49ha*Because everyone hates ashtray mouth.*"I'm trying for it! Running a little low on juice until I get paid on Friday so it's gonna be tricky. Thankfully I've been making myself more and more disgusted by the taste of cigarettes! After smoking for 10 years I'm finally making some good strides towards cutting that part of my life out.

Keep calm and vape on! "
1u49ha*Because everyone hates ashtray mouth.*As a non-smoker, kissing a smoker is disgusting. I feel bad for every non smoking girl I kissed while I was still puffing analogs.

1dfhwu*"LPT: It's not an ""Us vs. Them"" with ECR. We are the same, but different."*I kinda like this. I understand the frustrations of the growing pains at ECR. It grew up so fast and due to the number of new members, became less of what the founders envisioned it to be. I'd guess that at the inception of the sub, it was alot of vapemail posts, but grew out of it. With the wide spectrum of user 'types', one sub may not fit the audience. Glad to see a couple very familiar and respected ECR members over here which may ease the pain and give this sub some credibility.

28vmlk*I love my crude vape station*On your halo mods. Mine keeps leaking out of the 5/10 connector.  Any solutions?
28vmlk*I love my crude vape station*The only tank that leaks consistently is the Kanger T3. I replaced the one on my Ego and it also leaks on the Evod. Honestly I haven't figured out how to stop it. It sucks because I really like it. I just screw it on tight and every now and then I soak up the leak in the battery with a Q-tip.
28vmlk*I love my crude vape station*I know you probably heard this a million times, but adding the Kanger aeroflow valve to the Protank 3 is very cheap and REALLY worth it. My PT3 worked like charm and I picked up the valve out of curiosity at a local B&M and I can't believe I didnt do it sooner.

1yj19q*new to the vapeing world but though i would give it a shot... did i do well for an entry level piece?*"That's exactly where I started. An eGo 650 mAh battery and a CE4. After I upgraded I passed it along to my best friend who is now off cigarettes. 

Congratulations and good luck."
1yj19q*new to the vapeing world but though i would give it a shot... did i do well for an entry level piece?*If it works and you enjoy it then it is perfect!
1yj19q*new to the vapeing world but though i would give it a shot... did i do well for an entry level piece?*Good beginner setup, I would suggest upgrading to a tank thats glass rather than plastic though at some point in the future
1yj19q*new to the vapeing world but though i would give it a shot... did i do well for an entry level piece?*"My suggestion for slight upgrades would be to jump to the iClear 16 clearomizer ($5-$6).  It's nearly the same as the CE4 (other CE4s?), but it has twice as many wicks as most others.  Also, you may want to switch to the eGo-C Twist battery ($25 for a 650) - it has more circuit protection, plus variable voltage so you can get your vape just right!

*Edit* for clarification"
1yj19q*new to the vapeing world but though i would give it a shot... did i do well for an entry level piece?*That's exactly the same as mine. I've had no problems with it so far!
1yj19q*new to the vapeing world but though i would give it a shot... did i do well for an entry level piece?*Great choice.  Good basic PV system.   I'd switch the tank for a pro tank mini IMO
1yj19q*new to the vapeing world but though i would give it a shot... did i do well for an entry level piece?*"Second the protank mini, or possibly an Evod (both Kanger)

But in general?  You did miles better than any cig-a-like stick.  Getting an actual battery and tank setup was your first WIN.

If you are serious about quitting, or just starting a new hobby. This was a great choice to keep you doing it.

When you are ready to upgrade, I'd look at the Innoken batteries,  my MVP2 is serving all my needs beyond expectation and my Protank2 mini is more than good enough (though I'm thinking Protank3 soon to try dual coils)

Enjoy!  I'm so happy to see people able to find and buy this stuff correctly.  I used to have to write down all the parts for them to look for on specific websites.  I'm not an Evangelist or anything, but I'm happy to help and your post made me happy that word is getting out about the proper way to Vape."
1yj19q*new to the vapeing world but though i would give it a shot... did i do well for an entry level piece?*"Leagues better than what I started with.  I started with a KR808d1 cigsize, with 3.0ohm off brand cartos.

I'm personally not a fan of Protanks or clearomizers in general, but if it works for you, no sense in fixing what isn't broken!"
1yj19q*new to the vapeing world but though i would give it a shot... did i do well for an entry level piece?*all matchey matchey and shit. looks nice. you'll be upgrading soon though, lots of us start out on beginner vapes like that, and most of us upgrade to a mod that you can drop batteries into.
1xgzo0*I am new to the vaping world, some advice?*"You might want to learn how to ""dry burn"" the coils so you can hopefully get a bit more use out of them.  Dry burning helps burn off the crud on the coil that accumulates with use.  Check out my guide [here](http://www.321vape.com/blogs/news/10899953-how-to-dry-burn-your-t3s-to-clean-the-coil)"
1xgzo0*I am new to the vaping world, some advice?*"So this is my setup. 

I'm fairly new and I know you guys have big wonderful mod, but what do you think about this for a new starter? 

Also I was wondering, how often do I need or should clean up the tank? And do I have to buy new ones like this one pretty often or can I keep it? 

Thanks and happy vaping! "
1xgzo0*I am new to the vaping world, some advice?*This is the only set up you'll really ever need.  If you do decide to move on to a mod, keep this thing handy as a reliable back-up.  As for the burnt taste, make sure the wick gets thoroughly soaked with juice before using it.  I usually just let it sit exactly like your picture with a full tank for about 10 minutes.  Looks like a twist, so make sure you start out with a lower setting, like a 3.8.  Mine usually vaps best around 4.0, but this will vary depending upon the juice.  If you still have a burnt taste, try replacing the atomizer inside, let the wick soak, and try again.  Good luck!
1xgzo0*I am new to the vaping world, some advice?*Do you do Pest Control for a living? I just gifted this exact setup to 4 coworkers is the reason I ask.
1xgzo0*I am new to the vaping world, some advice?*Great starter. Use it until it no longer satisifes you then look around for something else. EVODs are nice just dont put anything in it that will crack the plastic (mainly citrus flavors)
1xgzo0*I am new to the vaping world, some advice?*it looks great! what flavors have you tried? I like vanilla and mixed fruit, myself. I've tried pineapple and it was good too. 
1xgzo0*I am new to the vaping world, some advice?*Best advice I could give based on your setup would be to remove the silica wicks from the coil and replace them with cotton--you can use a cotton ball...just tear a small bit off, roll it up, put it in, and trim it.  Immediate flavor enhancement.
1xgzo0*I am new to the vaping world, some advice?*Welcome to the vapelife!
1xgzo0*I am new to the vaping world, some advice?*You guys are awesome. So many good advice here! Thanks for all :)

This is how it looked before I even tried putting a battery in it. You can't really tell from the pic but it also looks slightly dented in person.

[Here's one of the scratches in the paint and gouges around the rocker power up/down buttons.](http://i.imgur.com/ffPEGWS.jpg) And [here is the other side of the rocker power up/down button](http://i.imgur.com/ygbr3gJ.jpg). The gouge on this side didn't come out in the picture at all, but I circled it and you can see that line - it is the deepest of the bunch.

[There is even scratching on the top cap - like he screwed in an atty way too hard at the factory.](http://i.imgur.com/uRvDlGk.jpg)

These pictures are all post gentle grime removal with my finger, by the way.

I could get past these cosmetic flaws. Really I could. But they're just icing on the cake for a device that wont fire out of the box (but will with a ProVari end cap), and has a screen that doesn't work. On top of my bad experience with their customer service it's just.. Incredibly disheartening."

1zkzt8*L.A. E-Cigarette Ban Approved*Hopefully people will pull together and write to the mayor and sign petitions and he will veto it...but I doubt it. The hearing in my state is in a few days and I've done all I can to help stop it but I feel like it's going to become a national trend to ban it indoors and lump us in with smokers. I don't mind a bar or restaurant owner banning it in his own establishment, its his right t do so, I don't have a problem with waiting until I'm in my car to vape what I DO have a problem with is being forced back outside with people on analogs and being subjected to the smoke and environment when I've tried so hard for so long to be smoke free. Its like waving a bottle of Whiskey in front of an AA meeting.  
1zkzt8*L.A. E-Cigarette Ban Approved*Im trying to quit smoking and have been vaping for a week. In my opinion, it is a healthier alternative to tar and other chemicals in ciggarettes.

1zkzt8*L.A. E-Cigarette Ban Approved*I'd love to see how this is enforced. What exactly will they be banning? Because if they're going to ban 0 nicotine liquids, they'd better ban smoke machines too. I have a feeling this will not get much momentum.

1hvom1*Professor: Nicotine does not cause cigarette addiction | The State Press*Interesting article, but doesn't the success of e-cigarettes (at least anecdotally, since I don't think there are enough studies out yet) do something to disprove Killeen's hypothesis?  That is, unless people are able to go from analogs to 0 nic juice and quit as successfully as those of us who start with juice that has nicotine in it...
1hvom1*Professor: Nicotine does not cause cigarette addiction | The State Press*While I agree that vaping helps people quit and cigarettes are more addictive, this claim is BS.  It's not a peer reviewed study, just an anecdote.  Nicotine has been proven to be addictive comparable to caffeine, when isolated from.cigarettes.

As far as using a flat top battery/rare earth magnet combo for a device that requires nipple top batteries...Yea or nay? I've been reading conflicting threads in the flashlight forums. The two biggest answers are:

1. It is a bad idea because the magnet might become unattached, therefore screwing up the device.
2. It is safe as long as the magnets are semi-permanently attached to the positive end of the battery with a tiny drop of solder.

2hsjlt*Warning issued to pet owners in Northampton after puppy Elton chews an e-cigarette*"1) Of course there is a 300% rise in something that has only been around about a decade and is lately really picking up.

I accidentally got a good amount of juice in my eyes and man, I was way out of it for like 3 hours.  Given, that's not the same, my point is that I think it takes a very large amount of the stuff to be extremely poisonous.  I'm getting tired of these things blowing up and giving ammo to the vaper haters out there..."

This type of laziness/stupidity is just what the vape industry does not need."
2hsjlt*Warning issued to pet owners in Northampton after puppy Elton chews an e-cigarette*This is something everyone with pets or children needs to keep in mind. It is definitely a poison, and you need to store it like you would all your other poisons. If you have toddlers, you always put locks on the cabinets that contain your cleaning supplies, and you keep your medicines out of reach. You need to do that with e-cigarettes too, especially the juice or your tanks. We have really good, strong zippered cases that you can buy a lock for, to keep your stuff out of reach. Remember that it probably smells really good to dogs and children, smells like candy or food. Just play it safe, and your family will be safe!

2e5o1l*My IPV2. I just wanted a regulated device, but I get this instead...*That's shitty luck.  Good thing these have manufacturer warranty but the vendor should at have a 30 day warranty too.
2e5o1l*My IPV2. I just wanted a regulated device, but I get this instead...*Should have a warranty. Contact your vendor. That really sucks though. It's a great box, I'm sure you'll love it once you get a functional one.
2e5o1l*My IPV2. I just wanted a regulated device, but I get this instead...*I've been following the issues, loves, hates, experiences etc... Eciggity has had great customer service taking care of the devices, from others I've talked to. For the most part the problems they had reported about them were like other vendors, lots of preorder drama due to entitlement issues and people feeling like they should have their devices before person x, etc. I think they'll replace it for you. I fell madly in love with my IPV, I didn't have problems with the screws or anything, but after a week or two of use I woke up and it was firing and reading ohms erratic as he'll, either the 510 connector or the chip fried. But besides that I loved it, I'm waiting on my replacement. I bought a hex ohm to hold me over in the mean time, the OKR is nice and strictly business but I miss the range of the IPV 2 and the power in such a small form factor. I hope you see as much positive as I did when you get your replacement. Good luck.
2e5o1l*My IPV2. I just wanted a regulated device, but I get this instead...*What are you people doing to pull these out? I have a v2 from the first shipment... I've had 0 problems, and I couldn't pull that out if I tried. The only way I can see this happening is if you dropped it, and the Atty tweaked it real hard, or if your RDA had a very tight top cap and you pulled so hard that this popped out, which would happen with most any device with a glued 510 connection.

1hl505*Make Me A Liar Vape Mail!*"So, during a conversation last week, I told one of you that I would never pay $100+ for a mod. I run co-ops for a reason. And, really, I love the vape from my Vamo more than any other mod I own.

That same day, this mod was posted on the FB Vape Auctions page and I was drawn to it for some reason.  Starting bid was $175. 

I told my wife that I was going to eat my words because I really wanted this mod. I don't know which feature called to me the most - but I liked the DNA20 chip, the brass for the button surrounds, and the green powder coating. 

Anyways, I told her I'd bid the $175 and if I got it, cool. If I was outbid, then it wasn't meant to be.

The auction was on for only 25 hours and although many people saved their spot so they could watch the auction, no one else ended up bidding.

I received the mod today and I am blown away by how much I like it. It hits like a fucking freight train!

TL;DR: Vape mail today made me a liar and I now own a mod I paid $175 for. "

The doctor helps him with the first dosage and he heads home thereafter. 

When it came time to take the second one for the day. The man is having a little trouble with it so he asks his wife for help. She agrees, but only after making a snarky remarked about how ""big"" they are. They head to the bathroom where the man assumes the position in front of the sink. The wife places a hand on his shoulder and gives him the medicine. He gasps and jumps back in shock.

These concerns are all valid, but should hopefully be addressed easily without overregulation.  Most of the arguments they use sound like a dyhydrogenmonoxide article. Intentionally focusing on the extremes to gen up outrage.

Why can't anyone have an honest discussion about e-liquid and e-cigarettes instead of sensationalizing it?  You can't reason someone out of an opinion they didn't reason themselves into.

Evidence of the potential dangers is already emerging.*At the end of the article, he states that some liquids can be ordered on the internet with 2.4 percent nicotine or even 10 percent nicotine present in it. That's true, but only true for liquid nicotine solutions. The ten percent presence is what you get with buying 100mg Nicotine solution, which I use to make e-liquids with. Once that is diluted into the e-liquid, for one of my 16mg juices, we are looking at a total of 0.48% actual nicotine in the overall product. So ... that claim was grossly taken out of context. He states these percentages in close relation to the end product, e-liquid. Which is blatantly false. But at the same time, he doesn't state that that is what is present in e-lquids. Dirty journalism. The actual percentages in the end product are not enough to cause fatality, unless taken in very very high doses. And I don't know about anyone else, but my nicotine solution is no where near the reach of children. Also, it doesn't smell good, it tastes horrible, and the bottle it comes in is about as appealing to a kid as drinking cleaning solvent. Actually, less appealing, considering that cleaning solvents are usually labeled with colors.

Get a battery/mod. There are rechargeable ones such as the Innoken VW which allows you to adjust wattage to your preferred throat hit/mouth feel.

Get a tank. I prefer to switch out pre-assembled atomizers and don't fuss with rebuildables. The kangertech Aerotank mega, or the aerotank mini perform well for me. Only difference between the two is the size of tank. 

After these costs, you need e liquid. I spend about $150 a month on fluid but by no means am I bargain shopping. I have a local shop with a particular fluid that's pricy.

I consume about 5 ml a day. That's about two tanks in my mega, so I only fill twice in a day. I have an iTaste 134, which is essentially a iTaste VW but massive and takes 18650 batteries for easy back up energy.

>Are there any quality vaporizers that aren't as hard on the wallet?

There's a number of options. For around $50 you can get a decent starter kit, but with parts that will need to be upgraded for most vapers(some people get by on the simple stuff, most advance after a little while). I would recommend having more like $100, you can get a much nicer kit. 

>If so, which one offers the greatest cost to quality ratio?

The around $50 option is an evod start kit. single battery if you smoke less than 1PAD, dual battery if you smoke more. These are good devices, but they don't have the power most vapers need, which is why many will move past these(I used ego pens for maybe 2-3 months, now they're just backups).

The under $100 kit is the MVP v2 starter kit. This should be well under $100, but depending on you source it could be as much as $65-75 *for the kit*(it shouldn't be that much just for the device). The MVP is a box mod, so you may have issues with form factor. But I highly recommend trying to get over it. My MVP has been my workhorse for the past 8 months(I also have a cana and mechs, but the MVP is always with me).

>A few more questions:
>How much more expensive is vaping (after the initial setup cost) than smoking?

It's a little hard to answer, because you're spending habits are so different. When i was smoking, I spent $7 a day on a pack, everyday. Occasionally I would buy two at once, but it was pretty much part of my daily routine. With vaping I make much larger purchases much less often, sometimes through need, and sometimes because I'm exploring. In the beginning I set a parallel budget to what I spent smoking. Didn't work. Admittedly, I dove head first into the hobby side. 

But now that things have calmed down, I've got my setup and a couple **A**ll **D**ay **V**apes, I'm spending on average about $100 a month, which is exactly 50% of what I spent smoking. This $100 is usually 50% juice(I like the good stuff, can be done for much less), and a new shiny thing every so often. It seems like a lot of vapers who are just quitting and not getting into the hobby aspects tend to break even between $300-500(totally anecdotal based on other posts).
 
>How long do they last before requiring a recharge 

Depends on your setup. Batteries are measured in **M**illi**A**mp **H**ours. For ego pens and other intor devices, you can pretty much consider this how long it lasts(ie 650 mAh~6 hours of vaping). This is, of course, more nuanced, but for our purposes today it should be okay.

>(and is it possible to swap out battery packs or something for emergencies)?

If you're worried about emergencies, have a backup.When I was using egos, I had a small case I carried. Inside were 3 egos(2 to use, 1 for backup), 2 replacement atomizers, and however many tanks I could cram in there(usually 5 or 6). Backups are your friend, a mantra heard sometimes it 'one is none and two is one.'

>How much vaping can I do before I'll need to refill?

Depends on the tank and atomizers. A lot of tanks tend to come in either 1.5, 3, or 5 milliliter options. Choose one based on your comfort and style. If you don't want' to carry a bottle for refills, get a big tank. If you want your device light, but don't mid keeping a bottle in your backpack, go for a smaller one.

Currently, the kanger aerotank and aspire nautilus lines are the reigning kings of tanks. They both make a couple options for sizes, so hopefully there's something that fits your style/budget.

>What all will I need to get started?

http://www.steammonkey.com/Gibbon_MVP2_Mini_Protank_2_Kit_p/kit-gib.htm

http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/starter-kits/products/kanger-mini-protank-2-starter-kit-vv

These are 2 starter kits like I mentioned earlier. You don't need to get them from these sites, they are just examples for what you should be looking for. But get a starter kit like these, a pack of replacement atomizers, and some tasty liquid and your forecast will cloud up in no time.

Congratulations on taking the plunge. While I don't know you personally, I'm confident in saying this is the best decision you've made recently, I can't express how much better I feel over 9 months ago.

Happy vapes!"
2en6q7*I don't want to die. I need to quit smoking.*Lots of really good posts here, but I wanted to add in that once you get comfortable with the setup you initially get, consider rebuildables and making your own juice. Your initial cost will be high, but over time your TOC will be much lower. If you go full DIY mode on this stuff, you can expect about seven cents or so for a tank full of juice, or a bottle full of juice to drip. That is WAY cheaper than a pack of smokes. Best of luck to you!
2en6q7*I don't want to die. I need to quit smoking.*"> Are there any quality vaporizers that aren't as hard on the wallet?

I have an iTaste MVP 2 battery (~$40) and a ProTank 2 ($20) with an Aspire BDC adapter ring ($3). I'm quite happy with the setup. I hear that the Nautilus tank in either size (~$25) with Nautilus Mini atomizers is currently the best bang for your buck without doing rebuildable atomizers.

> How much more expensive is vaping (after the initial setup cost) than smoking?

It's probably cheaper. A 30 mL bottle of Space Jam's liquids is about $20, and atomizers cost $2-3. 30 mL lasts me weeks. I usually get 2-3 weeks on an atomizer as well. At 12 mg/mL, that means that 1 mL is equivalent to about 12 Marlboro Reds (which have 1.2mg of nicotine each). 30 mL is therefore about 18 packs of Marlboro Reds. 18 packs of Reds would cost you more than $20-30. There are also cheaper liquids, but I'm a fan of complex flavors, and those require skill to dream up.

> How long do they last before requiring a recharge (and is it possible to swap out battery packs or something for emergencies)?

Depends on the battery. The smaller pen types usually last about a day, but the battery is also about $20. I haven't charged my MVP 2 in about 3 days, and the battery indicator is only on the yellow. Since it has a micro USB connector, I can just plug it into my computer to charge... which is actually what I'm about to do :)

Some of the more expensive mods require you to remove the batteries to charge, and in those cases, you can switch out the batteries. The cheaper (Joyetech eGo) batteries can just be unscrewed from your atomizer/tank/whatever and you can attach a fresh battery. The midrange ones like the one I have don't have removable batteries, and you probably don't want to have two of them. But, it's easy to keep charged, so there's that.

> How much vaping can I do before I'll need to refill?

This is a tough question. I personally prefer glass tanks because I know my level just by looking at it. You refill when it gets low. Easy. Some people prefer cartomizers, which is basically a tube that has a wick of some sort inside of it, and those are very hard to gauge. In my experience, you spend more time overfilling cartomizers and getting messy than you do enjoying them. But, you can switch flavors by switching cartomizers, and don't have any cross-flavor contamination. Also, cartomizers are basically what the more mainstream systems use (Blu, for example). Theirs are pre filled, though.

> What all will I need to get started?

A battery, something to hold the e-liquid, something to heat up the e-liquid (which may be integrated into the part that holds the e-liquid), and e-liquid. I would invest in a good battery if price is an issue - you can always run cartomizers until you can afford the tank system you want. If you get a tank system, you should look for one with pyrex glass. There are a bunch of choices for atomizers as well. I prefer bottom-fed dual-coil atomizers, but you should do your own research as this comes down to preference. A friend of mine prefers [this sleeve-fed dual-coil atomizer](http://www.vaporkings.com/Smoktech-replacement-DCT-atomizer-2-0-Ohm-p/dct-atomizer-2.0.htm) and I hate it (though it's a massive improvement over the cartomizer version). Also, it might not be obvious, but atomizers are not necessarily compatible between manufacturers. So you'll need a tank system that takes the atomizers you want or look for an adapter. Like I said earlier, I use Aspire BDC atomizers in my ProTank 2, but that's only possible with an extension ring thing."
2en6q7*I don't want to die. I need to quit smoking.*"Okay. Maybe I'm just the outlier here.

Cheap way to start: don't go online. Do you have a normal smoke shop? Do they carry vape gear? If so, good. You're in the money zone.

You don't need fancy kit or expensive modifications in order to kick the habit. A simple pen-type does the job damn well. 

First, the clearomizer. A simple iClear 16 does the trick quite well. [Here's what it looks like when it's taken apart.](http://www.smoke4you.it/images/stories/virtuemart/product/innokin-iclear-16-dual-coil-01.jpg) Simple, right? One of those runs four bucks at my local smoke shop. That part in the middle? That's the replaceable coil. As time goes on, you'll need to replace it. I generally have to replace mine once a week. Sold in packs of five for 12 bucks.

Fluid? As a soon-to-be-ex-smoker, you'll want HIGH nicotine. Some people say to get 6mg. I say to get 18mg. More nicotine means you hit your pen less. The less you hit your pen, the longer your juice lasts. A 5 milliliter refill costs me three bucks and lasts me for a week. It comes in a variety of flavors. So if you shop has a rack of testers, try out as many flavors as you want to find the one you like. If not, then some trial and error will lead you to something that you like and a rack of spares in case you accidentally aren't paying attention and run out in the middle of the night. 

The last thing you need is a battery. This is where I don't like to skimp. Get a big one of about 1300 mAh. That lasts me two days, because I don't constantly go around clouding up the place. I also recommend looking for a battery with chargethrough ability, which has a mini-USB port on the bottom of the battery so you can use it while you recharge it. Mine ran me fourteen bucks.

So. To recap the costs: 4 bucks for the clearo, 12 bucks for spare coils, 14 for the battery, and 4 bucks for the first vial of juice. So US$34 total to get going. I got a cheapo starter kit from my smoke shop that ran $25.

Now, I go through my 5ml bottle in around 5-7 days. Replace the coil ever week to a week and a half. So my weekly cost for my vape pen is about 6 bucks, more if something weird happens like the plastic of the clearo cracks or something. (It's only happened to me once in 7 months.)

I went from a $30-a-week habit down to a $6-a-week habit in one simple step. Everything else is just vanity. "

The nicotine is what makes smoking addictive but it does not cause cancer, it's all the other crap that causes it. Our theory of using a patch is, one gets a steady dose constantly and not when you really need it.

With a e-cigarette just vape when you feel rage starting and it calms you down. We find ourselves reaching less for the e-cig each week.

We both are in disbelief at how easy this quit is going. This is a true miracle for us.

Anyone remember when Sean Penn got a ticket for smoking a cigarette in his backyard, inside of a fence? Well that's Ross for you although cigarettes do suck in my opinion, now.

Here's Sean Penn's house where he was busted, for smoking tobacco, LOL. It actually looks like Beverly Hills, from an aerial view.

But, it is hilarious that you're sending them there to discuss RBA's. But, then again, the assholes over at ECR are going to send ignorant cloaud chasing noobs over to /r/RBA. I feel there should be more mention of ECF, those guys are kinder and the forum is better structured to suit new vapers.

1vm78v*Recommend me a juice.*Crank berry by fusion vapors.  It's incredible.  It's got a fruit blueberry taste with a hint of bubblegum.  Also check out placid, delta, and ski patrol by Adirondack vapors.  All three are really good and placid is my every day vape.

1vm78v*Recommend me a juice.*Mt. Baker Vapor has an amazing few flavors that may suit your palate and most certainly suit my finances. Those flavors are; 555, Coumarin Pipe, and Vanilla Butternut. With the 555 I like 2 extra flavor shots, with the Coumarin Pipe I like 4 shots and the Vanilla butter nut is splendid the way it's made. Another affordable option with good flavor is ECBlends; 555 and RY4. I'm with you on enjoying smooth-bold-buttery slightly sweet flavors
1vm78v*Recommend me a juice.*"After trying the chef, MBV, ELiqCube (their pink starburst is a spot on recreation of the real one), and Gremlin Juice, I've found myself hooked on Good Life Vapor. They were the first vendor I tried, then I tried the others and came full circle back to them. Their Zombie Blood is amazing, tastes like red sweet tarts, their Cosmic Crunch tastes and smells just like captain crunch crunch berries, and I've enjoyed every flavor I've had from them!

Nothing against the others, I just love GLV the most so far!"

1tcp4s*Something to keep in mind with talks of banning e-cigs.*"E-cigs and vaporizers are all already banned in WA state anywhere where you can't smoke.

I saw some total dirtbag junkie fucker on the bus hitting his cheap eGo/atty combo on a crowded bus, but that bus is known for random dirtbags and people smoking random things like no one would notice. I've seen someone hit a crack pipe on that bus, so by comparison an e-cig is vaguely polite.

But, yeah, don't vape where you can't smoke unless it's your own home or something.

People don't like it even if it's essentially harmless and you're exposed to more VG and/or PG if you're around a fog/smoke effects machine, and you get exposed to way more artificial flavorings/scents if you eat a Jolly Rancher or use an air freshener."
1tcp4s*Something to keep in mind with talks of banning e-cigs.*This comes up all the time on ECR, glad to see the message spreading. 
1tcp4s*Something to keep in mind with talks of banning e-cigs.*The only time I use my PV in a non smoking establishment, is after I've gotten permission. Even then I minimize my use, no big clouds and if someone asks me to stop I take it outside with the smokers. It's really not that hard, but I just imagine soon every city/state will be adopting such bans... 
1tcp4s*Something to keep in mind with talks of banning e-cigs.*I use mine just like a cigarette.  Still take it outside, except at home.  It's just basic courtesy, and I actually don't want kids to see me using it  (no matter how much safer it's believed to be, it still is not a great habit).  My daughters father in law pulled one out IN THE LABOR ROOM.  Moron.  I mean really, that little self control?
1tcp4s*Something to keep in mind with talks of banning e-cigs.*It's always some dickface with an ego and kanger t3 in a restaurant with a baby.
1tcp4s*Something to keep in mind with talks of banning e-cigs.*"Dicknoses with the intrusive vapes are why so many people want ecigs banned. Don't reinforce a negative stereotype, people! The US has a bad habit and history of turning complete ignorance into propagandized hatred.

1h8c21*Who’s Killing the Electronic Cigarette?*">The e-cigarette is an unwelcome reminder that nicotine can be enjoyable and that consenting adults can consume it without undue risk. For an anti-smoking movement that has been taken over by a rigid abstinence-only ideology, that simply will not do.

28j91r*E-cigarette Marketing - Watch this Senate Hearing 06/18/2014, and get out and VOTE!*"What a ridiculous load of tripe. Persona.l Vaporizers are not tobacco products, honest, they really aren't.  Cig-a-likes -- like Blue, NJoy and now Fin pretend to be cigarettes. They also rarely work to get people to make a permanent change away from analog cigarettes, though they are certainly a step in the right direction.  They also use the big tobacco playbook which is swiftly going to get all of us annihilated.

Their marketing practices are just begging for some crushing regulation.  Worse all of our glorious flavors and all of the artisan e-liquid vendors are in danger of being shut down all because ""according to the learned congress and their panel"" only KIDS enjoy flavors of any sort. Regardless of the 28-50 flavors of just vodka for example, that are enjoyed by millions of adults, or the thousands of micro-brew beers enjoyed around the world.

So utterly aggravating!   "

1vyd94*[x-post from /r/electronic_cigarette] - Here comes the propaganda out of Orange County - E-Cigs lead to Marijuana use, which then leads to Heroin and meth use*"Some observations:

* Hash oil has been around for a long time, and been used for a very long time in various applications. People will always look for new ways to use it. It's *not* a reason to regulate electronic cigarettes.
* Any semi-intelligent adult realizes that ""marijuana is a gateway drug"" is a lie. Why are they still pushing this?
* Their graphic ""A DANGEROUS NEW HIGH"" is designed for one thing: it's shocking and attention grabbing. There's nothing new about cannabis or cannabis concentrates or even vaping cannabis or concentrates.
* ""Majority of teens who use them have never tried regular tobacco."" Yes, and many people who use PV's do not use nicotine in them. There is no tobacco/ecig connection in those cases.
* ""Those running the popular vape shops are *allowed* to target kids."" I live in this area. I've **never** stepped foot inside an electronic cigarette store that actively sold to children, or didn't check ID, or didn't have a sign saying ""Must be 18+ to enter.""
* ""Marketing it to children... It's like a candy shop"" This argument again? Either do something about whipped cream vodka and honey whiskey and blueberry beer or shut the fuck up about it.
* Gigantic graphic that says ""E CIGARETTE USE AMONG TEENS MORE THAN **DOUBLED** IN RECENT YEARS"" yet makes no mention of numbers. Going from 1 to 2 is doubling. Going from 4 to 8 is doubling. ""Doubled"" is a scary term for parents. I'd love to know how much cigarette smoking in teens has declined, but they wont mention that in their reporting.
* ""Craze is so new... schools have yet to include the devices in discipline."" Who's fucking fault is that? You don't allow your students to have cigarettes, why would you not have campus regulations against electronic cigarettes?

Sorry for the rant, but this really grinds my gears.

I picked up vaping on August 6th, 2013 after several years of pack-a-day Marlboro Red use. Guess where that started? In high school. Guess where I got my cigarettes? From the liquor store down the street. Guess where I smoked? Right in front of my high school, in my car, in front of my house.

Did anyone ever give me shit? Nope. Did anyone ever question me when I tried to buy them? Nope. Did I ever get told by police to throw them out? Nope. Did my teachers ever question me about smelling like cigarettes? Nope.

Not only has vaping helped me quit cigarettes entirely, but it has helped me greatly reduce my nicotine intake, helped my wallet, and hasn't led me to hard drug use in any way. I can vouch for tens of stories exactly like mine, and those are just people I know personally. If I were to include you guys that number would be in the hundreds or thousands.

It tasted like fish. Wtf? How did that happen? I had to throw away my coil because I couldn't rinse that taste out of it. Idk if I got a bad bottle or what but it was the most foul thing I have ever vaped.
"
1s6j1u*Juices to avoid*You can also use cheap vodka to clean your tanks and atomizers
1s6j1u*Juices to avoid*Agree with the pyrex. Also I would steer clear of savory food flavors. A place near me makes a pizza and a dill pickle flavored juice. They taste just like it, grossed me out. 
1s6j1u*Juices to avoid*Gas station brand liquid, tsunami. I've tried mocha, vanilla, and blue breeze and they are all TERRIBLE. $2.50/10mL is cheap and it's easily accessible, but those bottles will be given away if someone I know runs out of juice. I'll never buy it again, and will stick to the US made mixes from shops talked about here on Reddit (Vapor Chef, Velvet Cloud Vapor, and Vape Dojo are great)
1s6j1u*Juices to avoid*El Kamino from Good Life. Taste like graham crackers with raisin bran topping. 
1s6j1u*Juices to avoid*I got French Pipe from V4L. I haven't had a french pipe so it just tastes like wood to me. But if I ignore it, it's pretty nutty. It's not my favorite.
1s6j1u*Juices to avoid*I agree with using pyrex and cheap vodka to clean your tanks/wicks. I have a few designated tanks for certain juices that left their mark, and I use them for similar flavors only. Taste is subjective, so I can't really say which you should avoid when it comes to flavor.
1s6j1u*Juices to avoid*Acidic juices leave a long lasting film, with my experience any how. I've had jolli apple (vaperlicious brand) and that not only cracked my cheap plastic bcc tank but also left its mark. Another one that did that was blue granite (by free mason) and donkey kong (by jet fuel) amazing flavors, but I'd suggest anything Pyrex glass from now on! 
1r0v5n*Are you never at home when the mail carrier delivers vapemail or want to receive packages ASAP?

It's called ""general delivery"".  Next time you order something, place your address and all the particulars necessary and c/o with your name.  For the name on the package label it as ""General Delivery"" (some people say to use all capitalization).  Check with your local branch/sort facility and inquire for specifics.  Some facilities may require notification ahead of time and you can also call and request them to hold it.

I used to do this for high priority packages that I didn't want sitting on my porch or when I didn't want mail delivered while out of town."

1j9jaz*Vaping treated as smoking! How is it the same?*I think this is mainly due to a work environment. It effects productivity if someone constantly vapes and in some work situations it would seem rude.

Grouping it under smoking restrictions just make it easier to deal with then creating a whole new category for it.

2i1hmw*whats the lifespan of a sony vtc5?*I would tinker a bit and check elsewhere for a possible issue. Clean your contacts, check with the battery in question against another fresh off the charger, etc. Slightly funny story, I was having a lowered hit awhile back. I have 2 VTC4s and 2 MKNEs, a couple Nemis, and a Panzer, vaping between .3 and 1 Ω with different RDAs, nothing hit as hard as the earlier in the day. Was tinkering, trying to find the problem, trying different combinations, started getting real late so I decided to call it a night. Woke up the next day with a chest cold. I don't blame the cold on the vaping (that would be silly, viruses and all) but I think the beginning of the cold was effecting my lung capacity before I even knew I was getting sick.

2hvku9*Seriously need help fixing my tank.*"Sounds like you pulled out the Kanthal and wick from the coil itself. Not sure how it fired after putting it back in but this might not even be the right answer. If it is that then it's an easy fix, just go to a local B&M and show them your tank, it's just a coil that needs to be replaced. If i'm correct this is what you need http://www.myvaporstore.com/Atomizer_head_for_Innokin_iClear_30_Tank_p/ink-ic30ah.htm

Coughing was keeping me up at night,  I smelled luke a bonfire,  and I was worried about my health. 

First I tried the gas station cigalike method. I also failed.  Miserably. Battery life was horrible and the cartridges did not last long. 

A little while later,  the wife bought herself an ego oen at a mall kiosk. After trying hees,  I bought my own.  It worked in reducing my cigs. I was a dual user. 

Eventually I quit cigs,  but Ive had my stumbles. Life happens.  I've bought packs.  I admit it.  But cigs are dor the most part nasty to me now.  I always go back to vaping. 

Just keep in mind,  its about the cigarettes not smoked.  Some of you will have no trouble switching.  Awesome.  Some will,  but remember 3 or four cigarettes is better than 20. Keep up the good work! 

Also,  don't feel pressured into going all in.  You don't necessarily need a 200w cloud machine.  There are tons of options out there from pod systems (my jet,  juul),   simple starter kits (joyetech aio,  innokin endura,  eleaf icare),  internal battery mods (innokin makes a bunch of these),  and external battery mods (to many options to give examples). I myself use a low wattahe and produce little vapor.  To each their own. 

Good luck,  and I hope this is semi helpful to atleast one person! "

No hacking up a lung, bronchitis,  pneumonia. Not having to go out in the cold every 20 minutes to smoke is  nice too! 

I also feel like my anxiety level as gone down. You don't have to worry about how your going to come up with cigarette money everyday, don't have to worry about do I need to go out tonight to get a pack or can it wait until morning? Damn, where's my lighter now?! 

I've given my uncle two mtl setups although he doesn't use them he has the tools if/when he's ready. Vaped forward to my niece and her boyfriend, they are now in the process of upgrading! Feels good to spread the knowledge to loved ones. 

There's also other vaping related subreddits too. r/vaping101 has lots of good beginner information and r/vaping is fun to browse from time to time to see how different set-ups look. 

Sure, it costs more than a pack of smokes to get started(doesn't have to cost that much more), but the benefits are well worth it! People here are master deal finders, we can help you find something within about any budget! If you are even slightly interested in vaping, I'd say it's well worth giving it a shot!

I smoked for about 20 years and tried to quit multiple times - the patch, gum, even Champex/Chantix - nothing worked.

Two years ago my wife convinced me to order some nicotine e-cigarettes. Immediately I stopped smoking actual cigarettes. Within 6 months I was chewing gum. Now 2 years later I haven't had a single cigarette since.

For me, nothing worked for over two decades until I started using e-cigarettes. This quite likely saved my life - just the new years before I finally switched I was having an enormous amount of health symptoms - shortness of breath, throbbing head aches, tingling and burning sensations in my extremities. I even passed out briefly at our new years party with a bout of light headedness. 

Now, it almost goes without saying, but since making the switch all of those symptoms have disappeared. Not only that but my health has made a huge rebound - I've lost weight since then and I've been able to go to the gym and work out, which was impossible before with my wheezing and gasping and massive blood pressure problems. 

It's impossible for me to overstate this - I am so incredibly thankful that my wife convinced me to give e-cigarettes a try. I don't even want to imagine what would have happened to me if I hadn't made the switch and I heartily recommend it to anyone reading this thread and wishing that they could quit smoking but had failed multiple times like I did. You literally have nothing to lose and perhaps your entire life to gain.

Pop over to /r/electronic_cigarette and see how vaping has helped us!*"19 year smoker; vaping for 17 months now. Tried the disposables, worked for a couple of weeks, went back to the fags. Bought a crappy setup from the equivalent of a mall kiosk, it broke after a week. Back to the fags. Daughter was born. HAVE to quit smoking. Came to /r/ecr, listened in on /u/chris2vaped doing a QnA where people were asking the questions that I wanted to ask. Invested $60 in a decent setup and here I am now. I relapsed once - on day 11 I had to have a cigarette. 2 puffs later it tasted so vile I tossed it and haven't had any since. Vaping isn't a magic bullet, you do still need a little willpower for the first couple of weeks - your body's addicted to all the other crap that's in cigarettes beside the nicotine and it takes a little while for that to fade out - but since then it's been plain sailing. Dropped the nicotine level from 18mg to 1mg, and hopefully I'll quit vaping soon too. 

Don't be afraid to ask anyone here questions. There's no such thing as a silly one. If you think you do have a silly one and you don't want to put it in a thread, PM myself or /u/twin_sis or /u/hometownzero or anybody really. I have a 19 month old.

Vaping is for ANYONE who wants to quit smoking.
3yymib*Let's get this on /r/all for the 3rd time! Quitting smoking for your New Years resolution? We can help! Pop over to /r/electronic_cigarette and see how vaping has helped us!*"Just turned 40, smoked for 20 years. It's been two years since I've had a cigarette, all thanks to vaping. I don't go to vape shops and I don't preach about it, but I will say that it works. First couple weeks are pretty tough, and I still think about smoking from time to time, but if you do anything for that long, it's going to be a part of you for a very long time. 

Quitting smoking has never been easier. If you have a desire to quit, you CAN do it. This tastes better, smells better, and you will start to feel results QUICKLY. Those results will encourage you to keep going, and before you know it, you've gone weeks without a cigarette. 

There's a lot of quit smoking apps out there that can help you count the days, and counting days can be important when you're quitting. I didn't stop counting days until it had been well over a year. I opened that app several times a day for weeks. I checked how much money I hadn't spent on cigarettes, how many cigarettes I hadn't smoked, what health benefits I should expect, etc. I was still thinking about cigarettes, just as I had for the previous 20 years... i just wasn't smoking them. 

Some people say to throw out your pack of cigarettes when you have a set up for vaping. Personally, I did not. I kept my pack of cigarettes, because i knew the kind of anxiety that not having access to cigarettes caused me. I kept my last pack, and it was in plain sight in my bedroom. It was there if I absolutely needed it. Knowing that I could have a cigarette whenever I wanted actually helped me. When that craving hit me, I huffed on that goddamn vape like a fiend. But that craving would subside after 10 minutes of vaping hard, and I would completely forget about the cigarette. I tried one cigarette after a month of not having any - my cravings for them had subsided, I just wanted to see what I would think of them at that point. It was terrible, and I didn't finish it. I took a couple drags and put it out. It tasted bad, felt bad, and smelled bad. At that point, I knew I had won.

When you first start, you might not know how long to vape in one go because it doesn't have the predestined time that a lit cigarette does. Don't be worried that you don't know when to stop. Just keep going until you feel like you've had enough. Vape for an hour straight if you are having cravings. Just keep going until you've had enough. You'll figure it out. 

So I recommend finding a vaping solution that works for YOU... and at this point, it's not hard to find one! Don't worry about the people who say it looks stupid, say it's for douche bags, or whatever stigmas are attached at this point. You're doing something for your health, and you don't have to participate in any ""vape culture"".

You can quit, and it's never been easier than it is right now."

Three of my grandparents died of lung cancer. None of them ever smoked. I am genetically fucked. 

I also grew up on a damn tobacco farm. 

I smoked for 15 years. 3 packs a day at my worst. With my health failing in other areas, getting off cigs was absolutely imperative.

I've been off cigs for 3 years. (well, 2 years and 51 weeks.) Outside of chronic conditions, my doc has given me a clean bill of health and her blessing to keep vaping.

Maybe vaping is still bad for you. But I never started vaping because it was good for me. It's harm reduction, and for the present, that's the most important thing."

I never posted much, but r/electronic_cigarette is where I started researching and learned what to risk a few bucks on equipment-wise to start down the path to being smoke-free.

Pop over to /r/electronic_cigarette and see how vaping has helped us!*"Here's an unbiased testimonial, I don't smoke. My mom has smoked 1-2 packs a day for 40+ years. I got her to try a starter kit that cost around $60-70 and the refills are like half the cost of smokes if not less. We were complete newbies, the local vape shop walked us through everything, had samples for her to try of different flavors and was able to add the appropriate nicotine level for her.

She was a die-hard smoker before. Pleas to quit fell on deaf ears. She was steadfast.

Once she tried e-cigs and finished the pack of tobacco she had open, she never had another one. She even tried to return the rest of her tobacco carton to the local gas station for a refund (not sure if that worked or not, she said she was a ""good customer"" so probably so). She had insisted on a menthol flavor juice and plenty of nicotine, within days she was eager to explore more options and ended up with a Tutti Fruitti-type flavor, when initially she said she didn't want ""weird"" flavors.

She was a hardcore smoker for 40+ years. She quit that basically cold turkey, saves a tons of money, sleeps better at night and has more energy during the day. I hate that shadow organizations advance a negative agenda on e-cigs. Even IF there may be some slight health risks, it is decidedly (to me and my mom) waaaaay better than the known risks of tobacco cigarettes. 

One of many success stories. If you don't smoke, you can help a friend or family member get pointed in this direction."

2qzovq*Let's get this on /r/all again! Quitting smoking for your New Years resolution? We can help!! Pop over to /r/electronic_cigarette and see how vaping has helped us!*"I am a chronic pain patient and smoked 3+ packs of home rolled cigarettes a day for 29 years. That is very important to note because I didn't just smoke for nicotine. I NEEDED cigarettes because they helped to control my pain. Even still I accidentally quit smoking in June 2014 and the results have been so dramatic it is amazing. I never thought I could quit. EVER! I never even tried. I fiddled with e-cigs from the very first Chinese ciga-likes cicra 2007 on out until one day on a whim I went to a local shop and bought a decent midrange starter setup (think ego and aspire not evod) and within a month I was no longer a dual user. I was a vaper and an ex-smoker. I feel better but do have more pain but that was coming anyhow. You don't recover from Degenerative Disc Disease and that is just one tiny problem in the grocery list of things that cause me debilitating pain.

My Doctors are so on board with this switch they do not think I ever need to even lower my nicotine level.  All signs of my having ever smoked are disappearing and fast. My lungs were always clear and good with no shadowing but there is some visible healing showing on my latest chest x-rays. So I guess I did have some physical changes in my lungs after all. I have lowered my nicotine though. I went from 36MG in May to 18MG around October and my next round of huge purchasing will be in a few months I might drop down to 12MG at that point. 

I am extremely overweight due to Celiac, Allergies, Insane amounts of Steroids, Lyrica, bad genetics and emotional eating to dull the pain but I didn't gain any weight when I quit smoking. I actually lost weight because these amazing flavors help keep the part of my weight problem I can control in check. I no longer reach for things I am allergic too because I have such amazing flavors to vape like a Blueberry Custard with an awesome name like Jizmogoblin from Mt. Baker Vapor.
 
That is also important to note. Flavors keep me from overeating. I didn't get that metabolic slow down many people experience when they quit smoking. It was actually the reverse. So amazing.

My Blood Pressure was never bad enough for medication but would spike with severe pain. The last time someone smashed me in my car my BP was 180 in the ER. They were worried I was going to have a heart attack because they couldn't control my pain. I have since then been in comparable pain and my Blood Pressure never even topped out at 140. This might not be a huge change but my resting pulse dropped from 86 to 70 which is pretty amazing for a sedentary severely overweight person who can barely walk. I did nothing but switch to vaping. 

My hair and nails started to grow like crazy when I quit smoking too. This is also amazing because I suffer from eczema over 80% of my body including my scalp. I was losing my hair last year and now it's growing despite that fact I bleach it to death every month to control the rash. My nails were so brittle from the lack of nutrients I absorb but do grow now that I quit smoking.

One final note is that I need surgery. My spine in my neck is beyond recovery. My cervical spine has straightened and is now bowing in the wrong direction. One disc has tri-compartmental stenosis which means the nerves are being compressed in 3 directions. I am the type of case that you hear about when someone just wakes up paralyzed. That risk is real for me. I need surgery. No doctor would touch me before because I smoked. The best case scenario is 20% fusion healing with a smoker. It goes up to almost 50% now that I quit. I need a tri-level fusion and that is a hugely complicated surgery with an obviously high failure rate. I do not have the Science to prove this only the various Surgeons who fired me because I smoked. They refused to do the surgery even though they told me I have no choice but to have it. I even had a Healer/Physical Therapist/Chiropractor refuse to take my case because he said he didn't think he should try to help me heal when I am undoing all of it by smoking. This man said this to me five years ago. It didn't even phase me other then crying my eyes out from the pain. I just kept on smoking. I was in real danger of death or a horrific quality of life but didn't even try to quit. Vaping has saved my life, very literally saved my life.

If anyone needs someone to talk to or recommendations on setups or even a freebie pack of juice, shoot me a PM. I have some flavors from Mt. Baker Vapor I'd be willing to ship for free to you if you need some help with juice and are over 18 in the USA. I do not know how many people I can help as I am on a very limited income being on SSDI but I will try. 

If you take anything away from this long post take this:

You can quit smoking. You really can quit smoking and vaping can help you do it.

Here's to a SMOKELESS 2015!!!!

Much Love and Healing to All,

Anna

I've had one dip since Christmas day and normally chewed 3-4 cans a week over the past 13 years.

2qzovq*Let's get this on /r/all again! Quitting smoking for your New Years resolution? We can help!! Pop over to /r/electronic_cigarette and see how vaping has helped us!*"I bought a vaping kit for my parents last year for Christmas, smokers since they were in high school (now 58 and 60). They didn't ask for it, but I saw my girlfriend's parents using them and knew I had to try. They both had been trying to quit with no success.

This year marks 1 year smoke free. They have gone into the lifestyle themselves and bought accessories, etc.

My father early on had a cigarette when he ran out of juice (while they were getting used to the system). He said it was so disgusting after vaping a few weeks, and I was so happy to hear that. They are done with cigarettes for good."
2qzovq*Let's get this on /r/all again! Quitting smoking for your New Years resolution? We can help!! Pop over to /r/electronic_cigarette and see how vaping has helped us!*"I smoked for 6 1/2 years. 1 pack a day, Newport green 100s. Got a vape a year ago, didn't really stick with it because when I ran out of juice there was nowhere to buy it in my area (I had ordered my stuff online). Eventually broke down after a day and bough a pack of cigarettes.


A new vape shop opened up near me, and I've been cigarette free since November 17th. I invested like $80 total into my setup, which was about a weeks worth of cigarettes for me. The juice I buy lasts me around 2 weeks per 15ml bottle, and costs like $10. I can smell again, and the smell of cigarettes is disgusting to me. Food tastes better, too.


10/10 would recommend getting started."

Nearly 2 years smoke free with e-cigs. Fucking hate cigarettes now and will never go back. Why suck that stinky cancer garbage into my lungs when I can still get it all with an e-cig (without the poison). I feel better, I breathe better, I smell better, My wife/mother/kids are happy. I just might live a few years longer. Really, where's the down side?

Edit: My teeth! White and staying that way. I was always so paranoid about the black stains between my teeth when I smiled. It was a dead giveaway that I was a smoker (if they couldn't smell me first). That's also a big ++"

5mlod0*A local coffee shop has this sign up.*"I rarely see anyone vape in a business.  There's something about coffee shops that seems to attract the cloud crew though.  I work in a coffee shop, and I routinely have to tell people to take it outside.  I vape myself, I've got ""sick cloud making mods"", but come on, some people aren't comfortable with it in their face, that includes myself.

I wish it was common sense not to do it at this point.  It's not like we are still in the infancy of E-Cigs anymore.  

I should get one of these signs for my shop."
5mlod0*A local coffee shop has this sign up.*"I say no vaping in commercial buildings. At all. I say this not only because of the obvious fact that people in buildings might not appreciate vape clouds, but for the very real reason that vapor will, and does, set off commercial fire alarm systems. 

In the past year we've had to evacuate our entire building over a dozen times due to people vaping within close proximity to smoke detectors. These detectors are required by fire code. 

I run a venue which charges admission to over a million people a year, evacuating and reimbursing hundreds to thousands of people per incident is highly expensive, per occurrence.

I can say, with absolute certainty, that people vaping on the premises of the venue I manage has cost our company at least $100k in 2016, and that was just at one site out of about 400 sites.

It's just common courtesy. Average Joe doesn't like Marlboros blown around him in a public indoor environment so I doubt he's gonna like whatever I'm vaping at the moment in the same fashion. I don't get why some vapers have this entitlement about them since they're not smoking real cigarettes they can just puff and blow shit everywhere because ""it's not smoke, it's vapor!""

6gzffe*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*"Last year, I was in the hospital for a serious motorcycle accident where I shattered my left wrist, fractured my right collar bone and bruised my lungs. 

Coming out of anesthesia is never a good time to argue or debate with a patient. The doctor said my lungs look pretty good and luckily I'm not a smoker. This is where the argument happens...

I told the doctor, correct. I no longer smoke and have been vaping for 5 years. The doctor turns to me and says, ""Well, that's worse than smoking."" I will keep the story short and please keep in mind I'm under my work username, but I was screaming about the Royal College Of Physicians and their study and when the doctor wouldn't shut up, I started to pull on my IV screaming that I was refusing help because I didn't trust an idiot with my life. My fiance begged me not to and that's the only thing that kept me there, but it was all bad...

Don't argue with anyone coming out of anesthesia especially if you're going to be close minded about it."

6gzffe*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*I work for a large medical facility. No vape or smoke on campus, even in your car. There is a no nicotine policy in place for new hires and they test for it. Tabacco users also have to pay an extra 100 a month for healthcare.
6gzffe*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*That's awesome! I wish the States would stop with the dumb shit and stop trying to convince people vaping is bad and that we should just smoke highly taxed cigarettes instead like good, obedient sheeple.
6gzffe*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*The thing people don't understand about vaping is that not everyone chucks huge clouds that can smoke out a place. I use small, refillable e-cigs and I can vape just about anywhere. No one one notices the vape because of how little the vapor I blow is. People who enjoy huge clouds should also invest in low powered devices for on the go.
6gzffe*Signpost at a hospital in the UK*"FWIW, this approach is not the norm in the UK.

I work next to a hospital and they are clear you cannot smoke or vape anywhere on hospital grounds - they do not provide smoking areas, you must leave the grounds.

You can also not vape or smoke on any trains (including the tube), or in any train stations, even ones where the platforms are outside.

Most privately owned public spaces, like restaurants and shopping centres are also no-vaping, and legally cannot allow smoking."

1u3fc7*Let's get this on /r/all! Quitting smoking for your New Years resolution? We can help!! Pop over to /r/electronic_cigarette and see how vaping has helped us!*"Both my wife and I switched to eCigs about 18 months ago. We were both pack a day smokers and she ended up in the hospital with breathing issues and was diagnosed with COPD.

Switching to eCigs has saved both our lives. We are both healthier as a result and her pulmonary doctor has seen her lung function get much better to the point where the COPD is a non-issue now.

We started with GreenSmoke eCigs for about a year before we switched to Joyetech eGo-CC with a variety of different juices.

Yes, we have swapped one habit with another but eCigs are 1000 times better then cigarettes and that is the main point about switching to eCigs. Getting rid of the burning tabacco and chemicals out of the lungs makes a massive difference to both ourselves and those around us.

To the anti-smokers who are also anti-vapers, you are all doing yourselves a disservice, your mission is to get people to stop smoking and killing themselves. By being anti-vaping you are taking away one of the best ways to get people to quit smoking and be healthier.

If you are thinking of giving up smoking for the new year and you have tried the patch, or gum or any other method that has not worked then try the eCig. You won't regret it.

Essentially they're showing that the remaining smokers will keep smoking no matter how high the price is. It's interesting that the government still ""wants"" you to quit, but if they're getting enough revenue from those few folks that refuse to stop, then they might as well keep raising the tax. It's a ""win-win"" if they can discourage smoking *or* raise revenue for certain programs.

Now the tax was instituted with the goal of lowering smoking rates and smoking rates are dropping, but funding hasn't been cut. This is because, since the beginning of the tax, they've earmarked a certain amount of the tax's revenue into a ln investment account. So even as the tax income is decreasing, the amount of money they get yearly is slowly increasing. "

Now, for me it's obvious the juice is chasing after nostalgic flavors of my childhood in many instances, but I see a gap in our argument if we are comparing flavoring that is tied to a specific candy/cereal to an alcohol with pineapple or orange flavoring. Just something to think about. "

As people grow older, their sense of taste degrades to the point where they don't enjoy any flavors at all!

Hence flavors are only for people below 18, and this statement is clearly true and supported by scientific evidence.

I mean, who wouldn't build a business industry based on practices that go against the law, especially when the market segment doesn't even earns it's own salary to pay for products, right?"

...just to name a few...yeah im blatantly just a little kid...
Pass me the Marlboro and some Beer Flavored juices...

NOW... what i will agree on, is some of the PACKAGING i see. Just because its a candy, cereal or sweet flavor, doesnt mean it has to have a cartoon character and some over the top neon color packaging, which DOES appeal to children... the flavors are fine, but e-juice vendors do need to be responsible about some of the packaging. Just because it taste like candy does not mean it has to be packaged like candy in a way that is appealing to children.
if you didnt have jack-asses using labeling and boxes like this...

TL;DR lmalways wanted to do adult stuff growing up, and now that ive gotten older and wisenes up a little ( have a long way to go ) ive worked hard at giving all that up and now love enjoying a sweet flavored vape like cereal or dessert"

I was part of the original wave of vaping. I bought my first ecig (evic) from a ""guy"" that I had to meet at a Tim Hortons.

I'd go out into smoking areas at my university and just chill, minding my own. Some people would ask what the hell I was smoking.. most wouldn't notice. 

Now, my ""vape dealer"" owns a store. I go outside and there are a significant number of people vaping with their drip mods and all the likes, competing against eachother, awkwardly blowing their massive hits into bottomless paper drink cups..

2tas8i*E-Cigarette Alarmist shares NPR article about Formaldehyde and gets sarcastic fact-checked*Don't know if this is going to get me down voted but the stuff Conley said, while true,  doesn't automatically debunk everything.  It points out flaws in the study and lack of inherent knowledge by the testers and calls for better research. I'm not defending the tests nor the testers but beyond the knowledge that the test involved a ce4 vaped at 5.0v everything else used to defend vaping was just based on assumptions too.  We can't fall to their level. If the anti-vape campaigns ignore facts to support their claims, we as  pro-vapers can't be evangelists that put our hands over our ears and deny facts and claim money conspiracies every time they aren't exactly what we want. Yes some (and sadly often many) studies will have ulterior motives that cause  findings to be less trustworthy and more manipulated but we have to fight for the absolute truth no matter what. If it helps or hurts us it must be found.

EDIT: Opened the scientific paper linked from the NPR article. ""The aerosolized liquid was collected in an NMR spectroscopy tube (10 50-ml puffs over 5 minutes; 3 to 4 seconds per puff)."" Seems like a pretty normal draw to me."
2tas8i*E-Cigarette Alarmist shares NPR article about Formaldehyde and gets sarcastic fact-checked*Wait. Sorry, I'm not a regular here or a regular e-cigarette user, but I am seeking some information. The image says that most people don't hold down the button for more than a second, I haven't tried refillable e-cigs, but with the disposable ones I found that I could easily (and did) take drags of up to 3-5 seconds (especially given how smooth it is compared to regular cigarettes). Are 1 second drags really the norm? If a 100 second drag would produce 100 time as much formaldehyde would a 3-5 second drag produce 3-5 time as much formaldehyde? Should I be taking smaller drags?
2tas8i*E-Cigarette Alarmist shares NPR article about Formaldehyde and gets sarcastic fact-checked*I could see this going around the Morman fb shares. Utah is aggressively shutting down vaping. For the children! But then again , most don't listen to npr, because it's too liberal.

2tas8i*E-Cigarette Alarmist shares NPR article about Formaldehyde and gets sarcastic fact-checked*"If you actually read the study (here's an excerpt):

 At low voltage (3.3 V), we did not detect the formation of any formaldehyde-releasing agents (estimated limit of detection, approximately 0.1 μg per 10 puffs). At high voltage (5.0 V), a mean (±SE) of 380±90 μg per sample (10 puffs) of formaldehyde was detected as formaldehyde-releasing agents. Extrapolating from the results at high voltage, an e-cigarette user vaping at a rate of 3 ml per day would inhale 14.4±3.3 mg of formaldehyde per day in formaldehyde-releasing agents.

So what I am reading here is that generally you would have to Vape at 5.0 V to get the allotted dose as described in the article.

My battery is 3.7v, I think I am okay with my mod.

**Specs:**  
1.6ml tank
Disposable
~~1.7 ohms, 14.7w, 5.0v~~

**New Info:**  
Device was confirmed via email with the scientist involved in the study (both by a redditor and by Dr F) to be a Sailebao CE4 at 2.1 ohms, 12w, 5.0v

-------------------------------------------

**According to the study:**
>(10 50-ml puffs over 5 minutes; 3 to 4 seconds per puff). With each puff, 5 to 11 mg of e-liquid was consumed, and 2 to 6 mg of liquid was collected. **At low voltage (3.3 V), we did not detect the formation of any formaldehyde-releasing agents**   


>**At high voltage (5.0 V), a mean (±SE) of 380±90 μg per sample (10 puffs) of formaldehyde was detected as formaldehyde-releasing agents.** Extrapolating from the results at high voltage, an e-cigarette user vaping at a rate of 3 ml per day would inhale 14.4±3.3 mg of formaldehyde per day in formaldehyde-releasing agents.

-------------------------------------------------

However, in practical terms:
>Based on calculations by Dr. Konstantinos Farsalinos [a leading e-cigarette researcher] from data provided in the article, the resistance was no higher than **1.7 ohms**. At a voltage of **5.0V**, the wattage would be **14.7W**. That is in the ""red zone"" where the vaporizer is being overheated and where, for a conventional e-cigarette, the coils would likely be damaged or burned. 

**NEW INFO**
2.1 ohms, which put the 5v test at about **12 watts** -- Confirmed via multiple sources after googling.

>Essentially, what this study demonstrates is that if you overheat a vaping system, it will produce high levels of formaldehyde. However, such conditions are not realistic, as they could not be tolerated by an actual vaper. Therefore, extrapolating from this study to a lifetime of vaping is meaningless.

Basically, at normal operating wattages, no formaldehyde was created. But, when pushed well beyond it's limits, the tank/atomizer creates a phenomenon known as a ""dry hit"". The atomizer burns faster than the juice is wicked, and this burns the insulator, the wick, and possibly even slightly melts the resistance wire. Some of which will release harmful chemicals. However, a human vaping under these conditions would notice this immediately and probably start hacking their lungs out. They would then dial it down to normal, and safe wattages.

>Using the high voltage for as long as the researchers mimicked in the study ""creates a burning, acrid taste"" called a ""dry puff"" that would cause users to adjust the e-cigarette, [Gregory] Conley said.

>What the researchers did is like leaving a steak on a grill all day — many cancer-causing substances might be formed but no one would eat such charred meat, he said."" [\[link\]](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/lab-tests-imply-formaldehyde-risk-cigarette-vapor-28386398)"

I'm a former shop owner here in Michigan, and this hit so close to home for me.

What our local government is doing to us, is going to hurt so many people.

Aside from the entire life saving aspect, I know so many damn shop owners that were just normal people who quit, by using an ecig...then wanted to open a shop to help others.  Sure, some are just purely capitalistic, but a majority or not...

Their life is spiraling right now, attacked at every angle.  Many can't even break their lease if need be.  Many will have to file bankruptcy.

This hurts michgander's health, and is going to absolutely destroy the lives of so many small business owners.. Some of which, sunk their retirement in to opening a shop... just to help others quit smoking.

It's so fucking unforgivable what the governor is trying to do right now.

I don't care if you smoke crack, it isn't my place to tell you not to. As long as you don't hurt anyone, destroy property, or cause a public disturbance, you should be allowed to smoke crack.

Similarly, the government has no right to tell me I can't vape. I'm not hurting anyone, and it's my own god damn body so I can do what I want with it. Fuck the drug war, it's rooted in racism and tyrannical. Fuck over-regulation of a supposedly free market.

I'm not sure how a BS in geology (I researched it) adds anything to the argument.  I also am not sure about the argument that 'vaping doesn't work without flavors'.  I think a better argument is that the flavors are not actually what suck teenagers in.  Juul only comes in 6 non-tobacco flavors and they're all shitty.  Juul is not primarily about flavor.  The anti crowd says ""they're sucking our kids in with flavors like Fruity Pebbles and Mountain Dew but Juul is, by far, the most popular one and it doesn't come in any of those flavors.  Cucumber?

2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*"Hey guys. 

Caught you on r/all, I unsubscribed long ago... Not because of any negative reason but because I quit nicotine entirely.  

A couple years ago I decided to give vaping a shot. With help from this sub I got a Vivi Nova. Remember those?

Bought juice from Vape Dudes and My Baker Vapor. 

Anyways over years I slowly would drop down in juice. I stuck withy he same batteries but now was on the EVOD? I think. Anyway, I was now on what I called 2mg but it was some other ratio in sure but barely any. It was so low I had to mix it with zero because Avail didn't sell them that low. Turns out I was accidentally using full zero nicotine for a few weeks and didn't even notice so I just....stopped back in August. 


Last week I gave all my vape stuff to a friend and her husband. I also went with them to the vape shop to get them into it. They have since both converted completely over to vaping. 

I no longer need to but will continue to support and fight to keep vaping accessible to the public to quit. It actually works. 

I want to personally thank this sub for starting me on the path to cessation. Thank you. "
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*"I'd like to point out that this article wasn't created by Forbes, it's just one of quite a few ""Forbes Contributors"" that do freelance work that gets hosted on the Forbes website. It even says on the article: ""Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.""

I'm not saying the article isn't positive, just that this isn't an endorsement by Forbes."
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*"My comment on Forbes:

I started smoking when I was 14 yrs. old as a Freshman in High School. Everyone in my household smoked; Father, Mother, 2 Grandparents, so it was “normal” behaviour. And when I went to High School, it was ‘cool’ to smoke. I ended up being a pack-a-day smoker.

After 44 years (and after trying numerous times to quit smoking; cold turkey, Patches, & Gum) I found E-Cigarettes! After using an E-Cig or PV (Personal Vaporizer) for 1 month, I quit burning tobacco in all forms (Cigarettes, Cigars, & Pipes) on 8/8/2009. I’ve been tobacco free for over 5 years. Personally, I have much better health and greatly improved sense of smell and taste. I have also transitioned from using 32 mg. of nicotine to 2 mg. of nicotine over these 5 years.

I can attest that no one would voluntarily transition from vaping to using a real cigarette as they taste and smell horribly bad!

As to the science surrounding the benefits of using an e-cig and the lack of second-hand effects to others, there are currently over 50 scientific studies conducted in the last few years showing the benefits of e-cigs & lack of harmful bi-products."
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*"It's been almost 2 months since I quit analogues and I can say I am absolutely happy to be vaping.

When I started smoking at 17 I thought it was cool to smoke, but as the years went by (21 to be exact), it became more and more something I was ashamed of. Now with 2 young boys I have been trying to quit for a while and have always made it a point not to smoke in front of them.

2 months down and I have on 1 occasion tried an analogue and can say I hated the smell. On another occasion I really wanted to try again what it was like to go analogue but found it much easier to just turn away. I'm now happy to be able to get my fix while sitting at my desk working and in the house while watching TV.

It's sad to see governments playing the ""We don't know how dangerous it is"" game, when it's absolutely clear that vaping is ""the best"" smoking cessation that real ex-smokers have come across. Yes, it's all about the money they're losing from taxes, and now I'm sitting here laughing at them because they're not getting my money any more! I say go find somewhere else to make money to fill your greasy pockets."
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*Been 90 Days today for me from being a pack-a-day smoker, and it's thanks to vaping.
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*I started smoking when I was 16.  I kept smoking cigarettes, at about 1/2 a pack a day, until I was 33.  To smoke at my parents' house, I got a freebie e-cig from an online giveaway.  The day I tried the peppermint e-cig, I knew I found a way to get rid of regular tobacco for good.  I didn't even want to finish my last pack.  E-cigs freed me from the embarassment of buying cigarettes (it made me feel like shit to go and buy them, knowing that they'd kill me) AND made me smell better (with my nose and no more stinky clothing).  
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*This is what I don't understand with all of these news agencies saying it could be a gateway to smoking real cigs...I can't think of any reason why I would ever smoke a real cig again. They taste disgusting after I've been vaping for a while now.
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*No no, its the devil because we arent getting our taxes and prescription money out of it.
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*Fuck yea, Forbes! 
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*That's a pretty good article, thanks for posting it! I wish more of the people against vaping could see it in this light. That vaping actually isn't the devil and that it's actually helping so many people quit smoking, literally saving their lives. I smoked for almost 10 years. Since I was 16 to 25, pack a day. I owe my life to the people that made vaping available and cheap enough for everyone. But Big Pharma and Big Tobacco just think they can cash in and screw over vapers... It's really sad that our government that's supposed to be protecting us and helping us is actually our worst enemy, not just in vaping, but all across the board.
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*Now I feel bad for picking up vaping, and having never tried a cigarette (and never will).
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*"So I posted this on another article, but wanted to also post the question here:
I smoked for 15 years and then 6 years ago found vaping and never looked back. I never tried NRTs, but I am curious how the Reddit community experiences vary from this and similar reports.

Share your story regarding your experiences with NRTs vs Vaping. 
How long did you smoke? 
What NRTs have you tried? 
What was the overall experience?"
2pisgv*"Forbes: "". . .vaping, at least so far as we know, is the most successful smoking cessation product any one has as yet invented. . ."" -- Support those who support Vaping!"*"I want to like the article but he doesn't make the point that these devices are actually used for cessation. There is no evidence that these teenagers and pre teens were addicted to cigarettes and nicotine before picking up a vape. So this is just going to be more fuel for the fire of the ""baptists"" as he refers to them. ""These devices are causing kids who would never smoke to start a nicotine habit"". "

You're fooling yourself if you think most companies have a mixing room like that. Its not the fucking CDC. How many startups have 1mil up front just for a clean room? Exactly none.

3wswj1*British American Tobacco caught bribing EU legislators to harm vaping*"This is the same British company alleged to be behind the vaping crackdown in several East Asian countries. 

Edit - PLEASE READ THIS EDIT - It was pointed out to me that I assumed (without evidence) that the FCTC members in question were EU legislators.  That is an unfounded assumption on my part.  It may be the case, but I have no idea if it is.  So the title should be ""Caught bribing WHO Convention on Tobacco members who influenced EU Regulators"" (Not as catchy, but WAY more accurate)

dfr38x*Truth*And big  Pharma who control the smoking cessation products !
dfr38x*Truth*"Legal vaping devices*"
dfr38x*Truth*How's it killing big tobacco when BIG TOBACCO OWNS (Many), and owns tremendous amount of shares on MORE THAN ONE e-cigarette companies... A huge stake.
dfr38x*Truth*"Blu is owned by ITG Brands (Winston, Kool, etc.).... Juul is owned by Altria (Philip Morris brands).... Vuse is owned by RJ Reynolds.... 

All big tobacco has invested in vapor AND are all investing in marijuana.  So all ""big tobacco"" is taking a 3 pillar approach to its consumers.  (tobacco, vapor, and marijuana)"
dfr38x*Truth*"Literally had a colleague tell me in the break room this morning ""You still vaping? \*laughs\* Man, that shit is going to kill you"". Just walked off and ignored his ignorance."
dfr38x*Truth*How tall is she!!
dfr38x*Truth*It’s so true. This popcorn lung nonsense is all propaganda at worst, misinformation at best.  No cases have been found if vaping directly relating to popcorn lung.  And that’s according to Cancer Research UK, not the homeless guy behind the liquor store.
dfr38x*Truth*Is that Joanna Brewster?
dfr38x*Truth*.....and batteries :)
dfr38x*Truth*wish come out new positive policy
dfr38x*Truth*totally agree with you
dfr38x*Truth*My state just banned juice and I'm sad
dfr38x*Truth*"Frankly I think there is a vested interest in pushing the ""it's big tobacco"" narrative we see above. Not to get into a pointless left/right politics debate (Republicans wouldn't be above doing it) but I bet it's awfully convenient that those who make money off of cigarettes happen to be Democrat (ie California's state government) and Democrats happen to be very anti-big tobacco in general. They can easily misdirect otherwise righteous anger through their lemmings."
dfr38x*Truth*"The attacks on the vaping industry, similar to the prohibition of cannabis (particularly hemp), are the result of several huge industries feeling threatened by a very disruptive product. I see these two as being two very similar sets of circumstances. 

The justification for banning cannabis in full was laid at the feet of marijuana specifically and yet hemp got dragged along for reasons AND more importantly hemp (despite being arguably more beneficial in every way than marijuana) became the back burner issue. People in general have clamored for legalized marijuana at far higher rates than hemp historically. The focus has been imo deliberately funneled onto legalizing marijuana (the less disruptive counterpart to hemp) rather than hemp or cannabis in full. 

Similar to the previous example nicotine vaping is being dragged along with it's less disruptive counterpart THC vaping. The justification for going after nicotine vaping stems from THC vaping. In the former example we have the benefit of hindsight and can examine the full process from start to finish. As for vaping we're currently in the middle of it but I would not be surprised if this all plays out in a very similar way. I also wouldn't be surprised if the attention rightfully turns to THC cartiridges soon leading to a new crackdown on THC products in which nicotine vaping will be dragged along with due to the current conflation being established between the two. 

The biggest difference as I see it between the vape ban and cannabis ban is that one of the largest industries in our country (tobacco) has large investments in this current disruptive product, vaping. That will be the thing that keeps it alive whereas hemp flatlined. However, established tobacco companies will end up with the keys to the kingdom and will then help Gov't establish guidelines for the industry that create a barrier to entry far too high for new competitors to enter the market. When's the last time a new cigarette company entered the game that wasn't a subsidiary of the big 2 or 3? 

Also I should note that thankfully the current administration has made growing hemp in the US legal at the federal level but most states still outlaw it.

54ahx4*Cigarette Tax (Satire)*"Fuck these dumb assholes. Sin taxes are widely recognized as ""a blunt instrument"" to combat substance abuse. The last number I saw indicated that 1/9 cigarettes in the EU were black market cigarettes, and in some areas 1/3 cigarettes were black market cigarettes. This doesn't only apply to tobacco products, it also applies to alcohol. In Sweden, my home country, almost half of the alcohol consumed comes from the black market... and whenever the government needs to balance their budget they raise tobacco & alcohol taxes. So now we have criminal networks getting huge profits from legal products, unbelievable. And these guys have no problem selling to minors. Good job."

54ahx4*Cigarette Tax (Satire)*As an Australian i'm laughing. The average price for a pack of cigarettes is ~$40AUD for the more popular brands owing to taxation. The thing is, our politics surrounding it is entirely about coercing people to stop consuming tobacco. Advertising cigarettes is banned and Quit Hotline ads play constantly. Its working really well actually but people have simply shifted from buying packs to getting straight tobacco and rolling them themselves.

3w409g*As seen in Columbus, Ohio*This is AMAZING! I live in Quebec, Canada and the government just passed law 44. Prohibits testers in stores basically. And puts vaping in the same boat as smoking. So no vaping in public places (outside or inside) and you must be 9 meters away from a commercial lot in order to be allowed to vape. We are trying to fight it but our government is ignorant and obviously manipulated by big tobacco. I posted this to our community vaping forum here in Montreal, QC and suggested we raise money and do something similar. Along with a website similar to notblowingsmoke.org and I was surprised by the lack of response that i got. Discouraging. But i wont give up ! This shines some hope!

3w409g*As seen in Columbus, Ohio*"Gotta love Gilligan's Island...

Anyone recognize that? Anybody? Beuller?

Ok, backstory time:

Back in the early 70s, Ohio was notorious amongst truckers for being the one state where you were guaranteed to get a ticket no matter what. All you had to do was drive through it to be a couple grand poorer when you came out the other side. Being separate from the rest of the states in that respect, it earned the name of another infamous remote location. Drivers, fearing the accumulated points on their licenses from this abuse [which also happened to be their sole sources of income] outright  refused to enter the state, prompring 'hazard pay' for running cargo to and through Gilligan's Island. Thanks, Governor Johnny! =D

Things got better after he was booted out in '74 after implementing Ohio's state sales tax. He lost to the former governor who had to skip the election Gilligan won due to consecutive terms limitations.

And now you know. \^_^"
3w409g*As seen in Columbus, Ohio*"Heart is in the right place, but this is horribly designed. Most drivers glance at a billboard for one second. To most people, this reads: ""Vaping Solution is a consumer created to the tobacco problem.""

5fk2pu*Senator Ron Johnson calls on FDA to cease implementation of E-Cigarette Regulations*Yes to stopping regulations. But, there is no mandate from the people in an election where the minority picks the winner. Period. I don't trust either party, on this issue. It wasn't a Democratic initiative, to begin with.

2qmll7*I finished a basic infographic/starter guide. Hopefully it can help some people looking to switch to vaping for New Years resolutions!*"

Looks like you put some time into this, it reads well and is easy to follow because of the pictures and fonts. In an industry that has grown exponentially,  it's hard to hit every facet but you've done a superb job gathering the basics without going too deep. Hopefully it simplifies some of the confusion for those wanting to quit and better their life. +1 for leaving out cigalikes and other junk."
2qmll7*I finished a basic infographic/starter guide. Hopefully it can help some people looking to switch to vaping for New Years resolutions!*"I feel like NO ONE ever mentions to beginners how different levels of nicotine vape, and it also differs hugely to each device. When vaping on a large RBA or RDA 18ml would wreck my throat, I vape at 3-6mg. But when using a smaller pen style device 13-18mg is fine. Also when I started vaping I kept messing around thinking my vape was too hot when I was really just too high of a nicotine content.  

Edit: Because it looks like I made the top post, I would like to take the chance to at least explain to any noobies a little more in depth what I wish someone told me! When I first started vaping, I wanted something that made big clouds, had a cool(not too hot) vape, and enough nicotine to keep me from craving. I knew this was possible, I had used an old co-workers mechmod once before and really enjoyed it. I got 26650 Mod and a big TOBH Atty, plus an ohmeter+kanthal and started learning and building away. It seemed to me like no matter what I did the vape was too hot or too harsh, but if I went too high in resistance(ohms) the vape just sucked. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong and any time I went to a B&M I would say it was too hot or harsh and I wanted it cooler, they'd just say to ""try a higher gauge wire, add more wraps, try new juices"" Yada yada yada. It took me a good 2-3 weeks to figure out TWO very important things for myself that made me enjoy vaping oh so much more. AIRFLOW, the drip tip I had, and the drip tips I see around at most B&M's were way to small. They all may fit a 510 connection but many of them have tiny little funnels for the air to travel through causing it to restrict a lot of air. Second was nicotine level. I kept thinking my vape was too hot when really it was too harsh. There is a difference. To any newbies out there, if it seems too hot/harsh to you, especially on the exhale, the likely reason is that your vaping too high of a Nic level for your setup. I found out that with my Tobh(I've tried many more RBA's and RDA's at this point and daily a Doge now) I could take HUGE mouth to lung hits, have cool vapor, no harshness, and really enjoy my vape. I had used Crappy eGo kits etc before and vaped them with 24mg+ nic content and it seemed like no big deal, but learning how to BALANCE airflow, coil resistance, and Nicotine levels are the most important things that lead to me enjoying vaping and being able to drop the cigarettes for good. This knowledge is just a base point, but for me is what made it worth it. You can get involved in all the different flavors, mods and atomizers out there but if you don't really learn the craft and what YOU enjoy an what works for you then you will just keep chasing something that isn't there.  
Best of luck to all of you, Merry Christmas and happy holidays! "

When I was in high school I did model UN with my friends. Mostly because I needed an extracurricular and model UN at my school was kind of a joke. I was interested in politics, but the idea of a bunch of American kids getting together and pretending to be other countries always weirded me out. 

The whole club consisted of a few meetings after school, then a competition at a hotel near Rutgers. We would go and just fuck around. I was paired up with my friend in the women's rights committee, representing Croatia or Serbia. We would sit around the conference room and doodle mostly. Occasionally we would make outlandish and sometimes offensive proposals. It was pretty fun. 

Well we would go out for a smoke at every opportunity we got. And over time we got more brazen. Starting behind the dumpsters out back and slowly moving towards the driveway. 

Well one time, we were smoking and suddenly from behind we hear our names. 

Oh shit. 

Turn around and there is one of the teachers from our school. She was a nice old lady, but I didn't know her all that well as I had never had her class. I was so sure we were fucked. 

""Hey guys. Taking a quick smoke break?""

""Uhh... ""

""Don't worry. I won't tell. You already know how bad it is for you and clearly that had no impact. Just make sure you throw the butts in the trash when you're done. Cigarette butts are the number one pollution on hiking trails.""

We were not on a hiking trail. Or anywhere near one. But we weren't about to dispute her.

48mlw7*They think ejuice companies are marketing to kids? Check this out.*Well all of you just do not understand how it works. When bottled e-juice is behind the counter invisible tendrils of vapor are escaping and cascading down the counter top to floor. When on the floor they drift under the front counter to the front door and outside. When outside the wind blows the vapor in multiple directions like the arms of a octopus into the surrounding neighborhood where it sneaks in under the doors of all the homes that have chillin' slowing creeping up the stairs to the bedrooms where the little crumb cruncher's are soundly asleep. Once a waft of the vapor enters their little noses they levitate 1 to 3 feet of the ground gently bobbing up and down with their little noses following the deadly scent of the e-juice down the stairs,out the door,through the neighborhood back to the vape shop. That's why when you pass a vape shop all the children bobbing up and down in their colorful pajama's in front of the store look like a miniature Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade at first glance. tru story bro's.

My girlfriend tried blu, liked it, bought the kit, and got stuck with some shitty batteries that cant hold a charge for shit. She pretty much gave up on it and went back to real cigs, since when she needed a puff often times her damn battery was dead. She is sick of the smell, and wants to switch to e-cigs, but hasn't had any luck as of yet.

Also, and this may be the stupidest question ever, are there a such thing as like nicotine free e-cigs? I like the act of smoking, but I am not really looking to get addicted to anything. Silly I know, but just throwing it out there."
1fk6d9*Dear smokers of Reddit, try r/electronic_cigarettes! There's an awesome world of tobacco-free vaping beyond Blu and gas station throwaways!*The community helps just as much as the ecigs do.

1fk6d9*Dear smokers of Reddit, try r/electronic_cigarettes! There's an awesome world of tobacco-free vaping beyond Blu and gas station throwaways!*"I've seen *tons* of people's opinions of eCigs ruined by Blu and NJoy. It's infuriating. Every time some one new talks to me about ecigs I get the same thing. 
>them: Yeah I tried them I just don't like it.

>me: Oh nah man, you just gotta try a good one!

>them: No no this was one of the good ones.

>me: Oh, ok. /sigh

More often than not they have no idea what kind it was. If they do, it was blu or njoy.

What's worse is, I'll let them try mine (1300mah ego-c twist w/iClear 30) and they'll pull super hard and draw it straight in and either choke on it or not know how to get any vapor.

Vaporizing flavored liquid nicotine is **so much more enjoyable than smoking tobacco**, I honestly think that anyone given a **proper** sample of a delicious flavor of their choice in a well functioning ego tank (or better), they would immediately switch.

If there's any advice I could give to a newcomer/first timer, it's this;

* Draw smoothly and slowly, not like you're sucking on a straw. Fill your mouth with it and then inhale. You're producing vapor, not drawing fire closer to you.
* Don't just buy some piece of shit random thing at a gas station. A good electronic cigarette often comes in multiple pieces, possibly from multiple websites
* If you're not choosing your own liquid flavors and nicotine strengths, you're doing it wrong. Pre-filled cartomizers (little things full of cotton that hold liquid, as opposed to tanks, which have loose liquid and wicks) are a waste of money and resources. You're paying to use something once that can be used multiple times.

If you really want that 'package/brand/kit' experience instead of scouring the net for good parts, being disappointed, and trying again, a good place to start is [Halo Cigs](http://www.halocigs.com/triton-tank-system.html). That link is to their Triton tank system, which has received a lot of great reviews, including some from people who are used to much more expensive, high level systems. Their G6 kit is also great from my experience, and is often more comfortable and easy for new users to get used to. The downsides of that sort are that adding liquid to small cartomizers involves a lot of leaking, which ruins the battery, and the battery doesn't last *nearly* as long. An ego system (like Triton) has a much bigger battery that will generally last significantly longer.

But most importantly, I'd say **do not rest your opinion on eCigs on your experiences with gas station systems**"

Ecigs appealed to me because they had less ingredients (now that i'm well informed WAAAAAY less) and because I could vape indoors.

Started with a shitty 7/11 one, liked it, but the battery sucked, and the amount of vapor/flavor sucked.

Kept on smoking two packs a day or so, literally until I found this sub-reddit. I was unemployed at the time and asked for the cheapest setup I could get. A very nice redditor sent me a pm saying he had a lot of gear and juice he could part with, sent him my address and got the package in a few days.

It had an odd connection (401) but I didnt know anything about it. Ended up taking the cotton out of the cartidges, and dripping the fluid straight onto the metal piece on the atomizer...loved it.

Searched this subreddit and the rest is history, I wont get too much into my setup, but soon and for cheap i was getting PLOOMS of wonderful tasting vapor, with a high nicotine content.

Woke up one morning and went to smoke a cigarette. The flavor...yuck..the throat/lung hit, WEAKSAUCE.  I realized I wanted to vape, and have been doing so ever since.

This is literally my pitch to my buddies who are interested, didnt try to quit smoking, and just happened to because vaping was so great."
4r8jpv*A great success*Little backstory this man was like a father to me even after he and my mom divorced he was still around in my life. He was a war veteran. He passed away peacefully last night in his sleep. Love you dad. So proud you quit smoking
4r8jpv*A great success*"Since this is getting so much attention I'll tell you all a bit more about this man.
He married my mom when i was a young boy i didn't find out he was my step dad for a long time. He raised me like i was his own child.
He was a war vet veitnam. He taught me how to shoot. After he left the military he worked for the postal service for several years. He sat with me until i wasn't afraid of tornadoes.
He always put peanuts in his coke.
Even After my mom and him divorced and i knew he shared no blood hed fly me out to oklahoma to spend summer with him.
He was never cruel.
He helped open and run a vape shop to help others quit smoking.
He was a great man"

4r8jpv*A great success*I know nothing about electronic cigarettes. Is this the same as vaping? My dad has been smoking forever. He's deployed in iraq right now and he, i and our family really want him to quit when he comes home in march. Are these e cigs/vapes really healthier?
4r8jpv*A great success*Sorry for your loss. Glad to see you had converted him though while he was still among us.
4r8jpv*A great success*[deleted]
4r8jpv*A great success*My condolences to you and your family.
4r8jpv*A great success*Sounds like he was a good man and you seem proud of him. May I ask, what was your dads name? I'm proud of him too and I'd like to extend my condolences by remembering him at least by name even if I didn't happen to know him personally.
4r8jpv*A great success*I got my dad (68) to quit smoking after 40+ years when I took him to a shop and bought him a mod and some juice. He's been off the analogs for 4 years now. 
36r2ck*Court says 'super tax' on e-cigarettes unconstitutional*"In Italy - and apparently Germany per the comments.  Solid logic too:

>The Court said the tax on cigarettes is justified because cigarettes are recognized as ""seriously toxic for health"" while the ""same supposition isn't apparent with relation to the sale of products containing 'other substances'"" different from nicotine.

Hopefully we'll see US courts taking similar approaches."

d7mq67*THE TRUTH*I approve of the intent here as a former smoker that vapes instead.  However, shitty images with false information only hurt things.  'Vitamin E has the ability to integrate on membranes' <<<WTF do you even know how to integrate?
d7mq67*THE TRUTH*It's sick how many people believe the media. I had to correct my doctor and give her hard facts. The new England journal of medicine published a bs article claiming e juice created formaldehyde yet the test was done in an empty tank with a coil of unknown material, heated until it smoked and created a trace amount of one type of formaldehyde. That didn't work well so now on to blaming all vapes for making people sick. Smh I've vaped for 3 years and haven't coughed or felt sick once. Big tobacco is losing money and I'm sure they're lobbying millions to the media outlets to spread this propaganda.
d7mq67*THE TRUTH*I've been making THC vapes for 2 years. Vitamin E Acetate = Chinese vape juice used to dilute THC distillate without thinning it like other agents (Terps, PG, VG). They have always been extremely vague about what was in these thcikener products, and anyone who cares about what they were making did NOT use that shit
d7mq67*THE TRUTH*"1. We don't know for sure it is only illegal THC oil, but it is most likely the main cause.

2. The main persons that have lead ME to believe it was 'vapes' in general were the teens that most likely used the illegal THC oils, and then lied about it, coupled with the fact that they blame nicotine cartidges."

d7mq67*THE TRUTH*I'm not scientist so I can't speak to how Vitamin E acetate affects the lungs exactly (This sentence mainly pertains to the first comment). For all I know this could be an accurate description. Either way if this causes people to educate themselves, good for you.
d7mq67*THE TRUTH*Wait till they come after CBD oil
d7mq67*THE TRUTH*Can somebody explain what the cause of the remaining 15% is?
d7mq67*THE TRUTH*This is good. People actually read infographics. I’m being dead serious. Let’s post this en masse on fb as opposed to the long winded arguments and calls to action. Maybe we could add something about contacting local representatives in the graphic?
d7mq67*THE TRUTH*So an idiot worded some of it.... Still, that idiot is doing more than most people, to get the word out.. Just saying.
d7mq67*THE TRUTH*6 people die from vaping. Even if its normal e juice. And it isint.  Look at the smoking stats like 400 thousand die a year from smoking in the states. Id trade 6 in 10 years over 400 thousand a year lol
d7mq67*THE TRUTH*Confused what does thc use have to do with regular vaping? Quality nicotine juice is freely available. While I have no issues with use of cannibinoids we really shouldn't be mixing the two.
d7mq67*THE TRUTH*Additionally, from what I have heard from very reliable sources, FDA doesn't really do shit. They are super lax on their policies and procedures - in all aspects (foods, drugs). Hopefully they will step it up after these incidents, but it's unlikely.
d7mq67*THE TRUTH*"Start spamming the governor, dount it'll change anything buuuut at this point anything we can try right?

6 months later and I now work at a B&M and have 4 mech mods with a 5th in the mail. Go figure haha. 

"
2kai6m*It's only been 6 months*funny, but here is the angle, I bet the lower pic cost much less then a pack a day of cigs for 6 months. also you have devices to show for it and not just blowing it all a way in smoke.
2kai6m*It's only been 6 months*"I think that picture is hilarious, I did laugh when I read it because I've had a very similar reaction.  I think in the 9 months or so since I started vaping, I've probably spent around $500 on 3 devices, a bunch of tanks and countless juice.

But then I realize that Marlboro's cost around $10 a pack here in NY.  I used to go through about 3 - 4 packs a week, lets just say 10 packs a month for simplicity.

9x10x10 = $900

~~$500 > $900~~

*-edit-*

*$500 < $900 is what I MEANT to type, go me for being a derpface.*

*-end edit-*

Plus there's the whole not getting cancer, being able to breathe better, being able to do it inside without having to go stand in the rain or cold, etc etc etc....   yeah... worth it.  Also, if you're vaping ONLY to save money, I think you're probably focusing on the wrong thing.   But that's just me."

2kai6m*It's only been 6 months*[deleted]
2kai6m*It's only been 6 months*"Well if your only purpose is to quit smoking and then move to 0 nic without the novelty of clouds and expensive mods, vaping in that aspect is really cheap. 

Now when you get into mechs and the likes that's what becomes the hobby aspect of vaping that's where you would dump a metric shit ton of your hard earned dollars.

So look at it this way you quit a horrible habit and you started a new hobby that's not a bad change."
2kai6m*It's only been 6 months*$6 Pack a day, year and a half vaping. I have saved over 3k. I have zero guilt in the probably $1500 I have dumped on vaping.
2kai6m*It's only been 6 months*"god, I've likely spent more on mods/cases/rda's/tanks/juice/atomizers than I would have smoking....  

but I've been off analogs for ONE YEAR THIS WEEK!!!"
2kai6m*It's only been 6 months*"Same here.  Although, I didn't really quit to save money - I quit because smoking is fucking idiotic and I had done it for 25 years, and that was about enough.  

Vaping is fucking awesome.

Sure, I've spent hundreds on vaping shit, but it's a bargain at twice the price for what you get in return.  For what you get in return, it's a fucking steal."
2kai6m*It's only been 6 months*If you'd stick to one vaporizer and just purchase cotton, wire, and juice, you'd be saving a lot of money compared to buying cigarettes. But, having no self control and buying gear like a 16 year old girl shopping with her father's credit card will not have the same result. ;-P
2kai6m*It's only been 6 months*I've been vaping for about 16 months. 11 on mechanical. Like $900 spent on gear. Don't even want to guess how much on juice. It's fun though. That's how I justify it, especially as a non-smoker before I vaped. If you're having fun, fuck it.
2kai6m*It's only been 6 months*Ahaha if I wasnt already broke Id probably be in the same boat lol.  
2kai6m*It's only been 6 months*"I started with an MVP and a Protank this time a year ago. I was happy with that, but then I started upgrading in January of this year.

Now I own a few of the rarest atties out there as well as some top end mods like a Vapor Flask DNA40, GP PAPS X, MCR Hiduron, Petit Gros, Esterigon, RSM Hybrid, and limited edition custom JM22 Hybrid.

I think I have a problem. My wallet certainly thinks so."

Now here's what's interesting.  It's possible to do an advanced search for companies by the name of the registered agent of the filings.  [Looky Here](http://www.sos.wa.gov/corps/search_results.aspx?search_type=adv&name_type=starts_with&name=&criteria=all&category=na&active=A&gf=&gl=&agent_name=Antonio+Mandarano&city=&zip=&date1=&date2=).  The registered agent for the Clear Creek Liquid LLC filing is an Antonio Mandarano, who's the same agent for the Zamplebox LLC and Vape Amazing LLC, using the same P.O. Box for the Special Address.  The only difference is that the primary address filed is a house owned by the Mandarano family (according to public property tax records).  The Vape Amazing LLC was filed on the same date as Clear Creek Liquid LLC.

2zu2x0*PSA: The truth about zample box*"I got a Zamplebox back in December. They told members that clear creek was their company, and that it was going to provide juice sometimes and act as a testing facility for other manufacturers. 

When I got my first box, 5 of the 6 bottles of juice were from clear Creek (and they were all awful). I complained, and asked them to send me anything else but clear creek juices. My replacement order (they replaced 2 bottles) even said NO CLEAR CREEK. Guess what company made BOTH of the bottles they sent me as replacements? Ding ding! More of their own crappy juice lines. I canceled after my first box. Screw Zamplebox.

Oh, and it took them over 2 weeks to even SHIP my box out, while other people I talked to on their 'members' FB page, who ordered the exact same box after I did, got theirs like a week before I did.

Edit: [Here's some proof](http://imgur.com/AYEeHo1) of the double CC replacement. "
2zu2x0*PSA: The truth about zample box*Honestly, to me, it sounds like Clear Creek is either a shell company or they were trying to help friends/ share profit and take advantage of their service. Shady shit. Also, there is a Clear Creek outside of Seattle, where they are located. Possibly where the name comes from. Without there being any trace of a legitimate business by the name of Clear Creek or any mention of it literally anywhere especially coupled with the fact the owner of Zamplebox owns their domain this all should raise a red flag to all of you.
2zu2x0*PSA: The truth about zample box*"now, i have no experience with zample box personally, but they have clearly been getting trashed on reddit recently. i have been following the AMA since i am so curious about their shady practices, and it looks pretty obvious to me. of course they didn't fully disclose their relationship with clear creek until you dug deeper and exposed the info available on the web. now they're on damage control. even if zample was merely helping with ""web design"" or whatever BS they claimed in order to help clear creek get off the ground, wouldn't this be a conflict of interest based on their entire business model in the first place? thanks for doing all this digging, hopefully we will get to the bottom of this shadiness soon. am i the only one supremely irritated by zample signing all of their posts with ""cheers"" and "":)"" ?"

2zu2x0*PSA: The truth about zample box*That's so shady, but I'm honestly not surprised.  From other ppl's experiences about how they get horrible juice after the first month or two.

3hz5hx*Time.Com - Vaping Is 95% Healthier and 40% Cheaper Than Smoking*"vaping should be much cheaper than just 40%, if it weren't for the overpriced juices..  the ""premium"" ejuice standard of $20/30ml originated at a time when all vaping goods were overpriced.

3hz5hx*Time.Com - Vaping Is 95% Healthier and 40% Cheaper Than Smoking*40% seems like a good average. Hell when I was buying premium juice and changing atomizer every 3 days it was costing me almost more then smoking a pack a day! Then I switched to unflavored vg with 3-5% juice I'm spending penny's a day. With almost no sweeteners and straight vg my coils are lasting weeks. Plus I started wrapping my own coils + venturing into DIY I'm now vaping for almost nothing! And enjoying it more then ever!

The article clearly states that this number is for disposable e-cigarettes. Before going on to refillables.

""If you really want to get that cost down, you can sacrifice some convenience and buy a reusable vape with liquid refills, getting the cost down to about $500 to $600 per year—an average savings of over $2,000.""

That aside, the big problem with this article is the inane and naive end comment that smokers would be better to kick it altogether. On what grounds, fuckwit? Vaping being 95% healthier than smoking makes it healthier than junk food: what's the problem? Furthermore, it completely misses the fucking point: to denigrate the most effective anti-smoking aid EVER simply because it's not cold turkey is fucking inane and dangerous. It's better that people quit to something virtually harmless than try for something only slightly better and never fucking get there."

2ey5ly*Vape Snoo*This is really excellent, it completely avoids showing a specific style of vape. Right on.
2ey5ly*Vape Snoo*"As a designer, my only suggestion is to keep all the lobes in the vape cloud on the horizontal plane. You appeared to have changed the orientation on a few of them so they're at an angle (the one furthest outside is the most jarring example).

So use different sizes and shapes of ovals, but don't rotate them after, and I think you'll get a bit better result.

The cloud is also *slightly* more detailed than the stock logo might suggest, so you might simplify the design just a tad (slightly fewer lobes overall and thicker strokes).

Otherwise it's a great idea. Nice job."

d1wo68*My perspective on the THC Vape health issues (cannabis lab director)*"> *the average cannabis consumer, cart user, or dispensary owner will not even TOUCH Propylene Glycol. They think it's somewhere between hydrocholoric acid and cyanide.*  

What? Really? For use in carts or vaping? I mean, i wouldn't want to ingest it because it will give you the runs, but that seems like a huge market hole."
d1wo68*My perspective on the THC Vape health issues (cannabis lab director)*"> When MCT first started being used, my reaction was to get on my soapbox to anyone who would listen and rant about Lipid Pneumonia. 

I've been saying this all along.  When the first stories started popping up, I said, ""Well, that sounds a hell of a lot like lipid pneumonia.""  The doctors are still hedging a bit, but most are saying it's ""almost certainly"" lipid pneumonia.  Which means it is.

And I've been saying that the vaping community has known about lipid pneumonia for a very long time, as it was one of the boogeymen that was used to scare people away from vaping back in the earlier days (I dipped my toe into the scene in 2009 and started vaping fulltime in 2011, and lipid pneumonia was something we all knew not to fuck around with back then).  But people tell me, ""I've never heard of that.""  It seems as our nicotine vaping community and market matured, we forgot our history.  Like, we still call mods ""mods"", but do people remember why they're called that? (because in the early days, if you wanted something better than a cigalike, you had to make your own hardware, usually by modifying flashlight tubes, thus ""mod"")  And somewhere along the lines we lost our healthy fear of lipid pneumonia.  I'm sure liquid makers never lost it (if they ever had it, anyway; I'm not sure many of the newer manufacturers ever even thought about it, and certainly very few in-house B&M juice makers would have worried about it because their source material made it irrelevant) and were diligent about keeping oil out of our juice, but the rank and file forgot to be scared.

If the nicotine vaping community a decade ago was the wild west, the weed vaping community is far worse.  And that's because it's still illegal more places than it's not, as you say.  But even legal shops are playing fast and loose, in comparison to nicotine juice makers.

> the average cannabis consumer, cart user, or dispensary owner will not even TOUCH Propylene Glycol. They think it's somewhere between hydrocholoric acid and cyanide. I don't understand it and I've long stopped trying to educate, it's fucking frustrating.

Why do you think that is?  It seems strange to me, knowing what PG is (it's an alcohol, not an oil) and where else it's used (asthma inhalers), and having vaped it for years.  If I wanted to vape weed (and I'm in a legal state, so I can do so safely), I'd probably explicitly look for PG/VG-based vapes as MCT scares me like it scares you."

""Good evening,

I am writing today to inform you that I will not purchase any Efest product ever again. I am a vaper and I will be buying your competitors' products from now on. The reason for this is that your company consistently lies to its customers about battery ratings. Your company's recent attack on Reddit user Mooch315 was unprofessional and unreasonable. I am disappointed that your company has chosen to harm the vaping industry rather than be one of its leaders. 

Please let me know if you have any questions for me.

Sincerely,

Norm Steadman, former customer."""

I am appalled that a company would so blatantly accuse someone of your caliber of lying or, worse yet, willfully misrepresenting your findings simply to boost your ego. This is uncalled for, and I will NEVER or recommend any eFest product again. 

The work that you do to ensure that we, as a community, are working with products that are safe and reliable is so very much appreciated. The fact that you do this by your own volition is laudable. I'm not the brightest when it comes to electronics, but I know quality work when I see it. Thank you. For your work, for your persistence and above all your integrity. "

I used to categorize your batteries as ""not an ideal choice, but serviceable if no better alternative exists,"" and I'd even go so far as to recommend your LUC series of chargers. Not anymore. Efest is now going right next to Trustfire and iLeaf on my shit list.

I see you as a small independent lab testing batteries for the community and not for profit, for the community's overall saftey and well being. The fact is I've never trusted efest batteries because they poped up specifically for vaping. I trust your tests more than all manufacturers because you have nothing to gain from the test results...

Idk I've been pissed about them slandering you since I read that post by /u/Miataguy94 which was very eye opening about how they do business.

I guess what I'm trying to say is keep doing what your doing I trust you a small independent tester more than a Chinese  corporation. Efest has never had any of my business but this whole situation has made sure they won't get any business from me in the future."
3yu20u*An open letter to Efest...you've gone too far.*"I am always sketched out when B&Ms sell Efests and nothing else, and avidly sell them without proclaiming their *tested* ratings instead of their *labeled* ratings. **I have actually shown *YOUR* results to an employee regarding battery safety, and been given the cold shoulder.** It horrifies and sickens me. The same goes for battery chargers, and I have to say that we should be testing them too.

I don't buy batteries locally because I never see 25Rs or similar batteries in my area, and owners are never willing to discuss proper battery safety with me. I don't buy chargers locally either because if they sell a Trustfire or similar charger, and then a reputable one, they're automatically untrustworthy to me. I am garrulously throwing that out there (deal with it). If they sell a terrible one out of convenience when they have a better one, their reputation is degraded.

Such ad hominem attacks from Efest are low blows and we shouldn't support them. The unfortunate situation regarding 18650 batteries is that because they are binned as A, B, C, and D by more legitimate companies and cherry-picked by accuracy (A), the others are allowed to label them however they wish because they're outside of US law. There's no law inside the US that regulates these things as such, so to speak, but people like Mooch, and technologies that allow us to test them divert such accidents and mishaps involved with these lack of laws.

We should include legitimate battery standards in regulations: 20A minimum, minimum mAh allowances, and tested battery curve legitimacy. The same goes for battery chargers and all of their variables. I couldn't care less if anyone here doesn't like it.

Your post is not an ad hominem regarding all this, Mooch. You're calling out the bullshit, and that's highly respectable."

3778xc*Congress and Big Tobacco Satire*"I think this is one of the reasons the media is quick to condemn vaping. Big Tobacco ran a huge scam on the whole country for years. There are studies linking tobacco with cancer as early as 1956 and the evidence increased every year. Hell they started selling light cigarettes because people felt like shit when they smoked. All the while the government did nothing and the media licked boot. There are books written about how completely in the dark Big Tobacco kept everyone despite mounting evidence to the contrary. 

The government and media both want everyone to know they're totally reformed and would never do anything like that again (even though they both still do). So if you can take a couple of shots at the little guy while still bedding the giants of industry, it's an easy win."
3778xc*Congress and Big Tobacco Satire*Is there such thing as 'small tobacco'?
3778xc*Congress and Big Tobacco Satire*This whole past month I have been told by many people how harmful vaping is and how it is unregulated and dangerous. They say I have no idea what is in it. I tell them I know more about what is in my vape than they know what is in their soda. I try to tell them about the studies I have researched and the results from the CDC, yet every day or two, someone tells me it is more dangerous. The amount of misinformation is astonishing

Opposite of the other stories as he spent two hours cuffed and sitting on the curb as they searched his truck and questioned him. Oh yeah, the vaping stuff was not an issue with them but they thought he could be lying when he said he was just vaping so they asked if they could do a search and explained if he refused they would call a K9 unit. He said ""Go ahead"" as he had nothing to hide and figured the wait on the K9 would just be longer and look suspicious. So hours wasted on all parts due to nosey, uninformed, busy bodies. *sigh*"

I was Vaping in a park which is on the property of an Adult learning center ( Used to be an elementary ) waiting to pick my friend up. Now I was about 50 meters from the playground. This Mom walks up to me screaming and raving about me Vaping in the park. Now I am a pretty lax person when it comes to moving away from people when vaping, and I made sure I was 50 meters from the fence for the playground. I explained this to her to which she replied that she was going to call the police, so I said go ahead. The police showed up about 10 minutes later, she starts screaming about what I am doing, and then all I did was pull out my mod he said and I quote "" It's nice to see young people doing their best to quit"" and pulls out a little pen out of his pocket and hits it. He looked at her and told her to leave me alone. "

2xffc4*/r/thathappened vaping story I found on Facebook*"Actually something very similar happened to my mother. As me and my mom were outside Walmart (my mom had just started to let me vape) my mom pulled out her vape and began to use it when what she would normally do is smoke a cigarette. I am 18 at the time, but I look super young. All of a sudden, this maniac super bitch comes out and purposefully walks into my mother cloud (which is SUPER small seeing how it is an istick 20W with a nautilous mini) and begins to cough very loudly. She said ""You shouldn't be smoking that nasty shit in front of your child!"" She said ""First of all, he is not a child. Second of all, this isn't a cigarette. It is helping me quit smoking and is completely harmless."" So my mom keeps vaping anyways and tells her to fuck off. This is when the inner beast comes out of this woman. She starts getting a little red as she says ""That.... Is.... So.... Rude!"" Now keep in mind we are not cloud chasing out here. We are blowing tiny-ass puffs. But then, our knight in shining armer with a Sigelei (either Plus or 150W there was no way to tell) and his Darkhorse RDA plumes a cloud that was heavier than my fucking weight directly into her face and walked away. I never got the name of this hippy looking hero. But if you're reading this: thank you. You are the hero this city deserves.
TL;DR: My mom was rudely yelled at for a vaping and a dude with a Sigelei came out and plumes in the bitches face never to be seen again."

3090ya*PSA: This is how imminent these regulations are....*"I think the general public needs to realize that this battle is not one over safety, or just about big tobacco ""swooping in"" to the market. Look at it on a larger scale. Like it or not, eliminating the traditional tobacco industry would be damaging to the US economy. (Note: Don't consider this comment as being in support of regulation. Read the rest first.)

There's the obvious surface issue of a non locally- and federally-taxed product competing with [one of the top tax earners in the country.](http://dailycaller.com/2011/02/28/what-would-an-america-without-smokers-cost/) We are talking about a product that the government heavily relies on for revenue. Increasing tax levels have not made a significant difference in consumer habit; either. Also a ""surface"" issue is the consideration that traditional cigarettes are statistically a habitual loop; you will probably be a consumer for the remainder of your life. A product designed to break this cycle isn't good news for a government that relies on the stability of the tobacco consumerism as a primary revenue generator. Couple this with the fact that it is significantly easier for a politician to suggest tax increases on taboos, you have a pretty good recipe for revenue generation. 

**Dig deeper.** [The health care industry generated $133 billion revenue as a direct result of smoking-related illness between 2009-2012.](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/economics/econ_facts/) Electronic cigarettes jeopardize that revenue stream. The agriculture and logistics markets would invariably suffer, too.

**At the end of the day, smokers die earlier. This costs less for the government, as well.**

“Smokers actually save the government money, both by dying earlier and thus reduce social security payments, and, to a lesser extent, by dying of relatively cheap ailments like lung cancer, a fairly quick killer, rather than more expensive, lingering ailments.”

What is a government to do at this point? They are scrambling to mitigate revenue loss, generated directly by tobacco. The possibilities are to either:

* Tax the vaping industry at the same rate as cigarettes are taxed. The con in their eyes: this still doesn't solve the issue of vaping being a smoking cessation product. There is a long history of tobacco taxation that won't be fought, and tobacco has a high ""consumer retention rate"". 

So, the next 'logical' thing to do would be to:

* Cripple the industry to protect tobacco-generated revenue and prevent any financial hardships that would follow suit.

[The government has relied on tobacco taxation as a staple of its portfolio for more than 100 years] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1862), so it's pretty clear to see what's going on here in my opinion. Sure, you can try to make the blow easier by hiding behind the veil of health concerns, and perhaps some of the lesser political puppets will take the bait. In the end, though, it seems pretty evident that the situation is about a flawed taxation system. When an innovative product comes along that saves lives and generate tens of thousands of small businesses around the country but threatens pulling the financial rug out from under an already economically-weak government, their solution will be to stomp out the disruptors. 

There will have to be a compromise of some nature, unfortunately. The government has been heavily reliant on taxing a taboo that we are ultimately eliminating. They will either seek to regain lost revenue by taxing the vaping industry, or look to crush the industry as a whole to maintain status quo. 

My two cents.

**EDIT:** A lot of people have been tossing around solutions; here's what I think a feasible defense looks like. Considering the vaping industry is largely comprised of ""small business"", there is no single entity that has the cashflow to facilitate Washington lobbying. I think we can all agree that lobbying, coupled with a strong association and rock-solid scientific studies, is the quickest way to produce tangible results. 

There are the likes of NJOY et al., but their agenda is different than the community agenda. A proposed discussion point is to have a single representative body carry out the hiring and management of top-tier industry lobbyists to give these guys hell for the next couple of years. Lobbying *could* buy time while the industry strengthens, and we should see some larger corporations of sizable valuation rise up and aid in combatting harsh regulation. Secondarily, third party scientific testing will need to be performed on the behalf of the vape community, which is not a cheap endeavor either. Thirdly, campaigns need to be created to combat the smear campaigns and misinformation being run against the industry. This combo seems to be one of the only ways real progress will be made.

The issue of funding is a big one, of course. [NJOY, for example, spent $340,000 last year in lobbying on the State.] (http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=F6953%20%20%20%20%20&year=2014) There will undoubtedly be the need for a good cash reserve in order to accomplish anything, and the industry is way too young to have corporate giants that will lead the pillage. I see this happening in a few different ways, ranked in order of efficacy:

* **Community Donations.** If you want to fight, pony up. I'm sorry to tell you, but an email to your Congressman won't be bringing any kind of change. Money fights money.

* **Fundraising Campaigns.** You see these with all major associations; the vaping industry should be no different. A proper campaign will double as a great mass-market awareness tool.

* **B&M and Online Shop-Solicited Donation Requests.** Self explanatory, customer opt-in.

* **A Weekly or Monthly day where a portion of nationwide purchases goes to the campaign.** A sliver of all purchases made on said day will go towards the cause. Consider this, ironically, a tax of sorts. The difference is, it will be a selective participation event and it will be paid for on the shop-end. State bodies use this method in other scenarios very successfully. 

**No one else will fight for you; in life, in business, and in vaping.** Everyone has an agenda, and for a fight to be even remotely successful, this needs to be the adopted mentality. Money will continue to be the most effective way to fight money, as it historically has. The question is; how bad does the community want to preserve our industry?

It was posted yesterday but I don't think it got nearly the attention it deserved...

In particular, the comment in the screencap really made my heart sink.  As disheartening as this is, we really need to let those words sink in, think about it, and then come together as a community to act.  We need to keep fighting and never give up.  We need to stay firm and not give in, not even an inch.

You'll notice that the parent comment mentions the push to change the grandfather date, but that 

> It needs to be something done in Congress as a law.

This could be our call to action - we need to start sending letters out to our Congressmen urging them to get off their lazy asses and actually do something about this, rather than just sending a letter to the FDA (which does nothing but certainly fools most of the public into thinking that they're at least trying)

**Either way folks, the time to act is NOW.  This is extremely urgent, and we can't afford to lose any more time.  We all need to rally together NOW and stop them from taking away our rights.  Seriously, I can't stress how important this is, we literally don't have any more time to mess around - we must act!!**

3090ya*PSA: This is how imminent these regulations are....*"I'm confused about why you merely link to an image of a screenshot of a comment on reddit *instead* of a summary explanation about what's up. 

The 'beginning of the end' sounds a bit dire. IMO there is no way to completely kill vaping. This is not flavored cigarettes. As long as PG/VG base with nicotine is sold then vaping cannot die. The worst that can happen is flavors are sold separately and you mix them together at home. Yes this would suck, and yes a lot of people/stores  would not be able to adapt their business model which would be sad. (maybe it would kill zamplebox though, a silver lining ;)  )

Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating ignoring this stuff because it will still live on in a different form. We deserve to continue as it is currently. I have only seen juice vendors (except for the few scammers, but they're far and few between) who care about their customers and post large blocks of text so that they can disclose info about what you're buying to the best of their knowledge.

I bet if we go to the e-cig wiki article and look up edits, all of the ones that say that it isn't proven safer than cigarettes come from tobacco grower states, or IP address blocks associated with big tobacco. They have no morals, they know damn well that inhaling vegtable glycerin or even diacetyl loaded juices will never come close to the horrible dangers of tobacco. They sell death, and now they sell uncertainity in alternatives just so their business model (get people hooked, keep them hooked until they no longer breath, rinse, repeat) remains safe.

I highly applause CVS for stopping selling cigarettes, you shouldn't be able to run a pharmacy if you sell products that are inherently dangerous. If I had the lobbying power of tobacco companies I could sell bags of glass laced with mercury and Cobalt-60"

Info in the Comments*"If you go to the [Flavor Apprentice's website's spec sheet list](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/specsheetlist.aspx), you can see the list of aroma compounds along with their CAS numbers by clicking on their ""List"" link.

This includes their tobacco flavors. For example, here is their spec sheet for the DK Tobacco flavor.

https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=344218

The listed ingredients are;

Ethyl Alcohol

Malic Acid

Cyclotene

Pyridine <2-acetyl->

Vanillin

Tetramethyl Pyrazine

Ethyl Maltol

2-Methyl Butyric Acid

Ethyl acetate

2,3,5 Trimethyl Pyrazine

Rhodinol

Acetyl Pyrazine

Beta Damascone

You can then use each of those compound's CAS numbers on the spec sheet page to find out which other flavors they are used in. Obviously, Vanillin and Ethyl Maltol are two of the most widely used compounds and are predominantly found in dessert flavors.

So I have no issue with what [Greg Conley is suggesting](https://old.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/d9kzbq/well_thats_that_from_gregory_conley/) in that all ejuices can now be simply renamed as a Tobacco Blend or perhaps just ""Blend"". Flavors are subjective, and the aromas are artificial. And judging by many of the comments in that post, most of you seem to actually agree that the labeling and naming of the products is irrelevant. We care about the flavors, not the labeling.

Onto the story...I *was* a part of that group until all of this started happening. Not to mention there was only one mod for the page when there were probably over 100 people on there spamming, ""**WE MADE JUICE. WE TOOK AN INSTAGRAM PICK. WE HAVE A COMP.

Everyone started being rude and controlling over everything so I just left the page. Months later, I hear from a buddy of mine that they are yet again trying to control everyone and when they showed me what the *new* mod was posting it was sad. He was being super harsh, rude, disrespectful, and just degrading.

Last I knew, vaping was not about sex, vaping was not about money, vaping was not about publicity. Vaping was about saving money, quiting smoking, and enjoying super tastey flavours that people/companies created.

It isn't ""vaping THC"", it isn't ""vaping cannabis"", and it isn't even ""vaping counterfeit cartridges"".

It's vaping products made using lipid based thickening agents...  Those lipids could be used in literally *anything* people vape, and being a lot more specific about that would be a lot more productive than all the ""they did it"" finger pointing crap.  

There's nothing preventing Jim down the street from tossing some hand lotion into nicotine vape juice.  Absolutely nothing.  

We should be a lot more specific about the lethality of lipids."

daxycw*Good news!*"The article came out on September 27th in what appears to be the ""weed"" section of a city news letter.  That was 2 days ago (and I assume the CDC said this prior to the article being published.

Long story short - they must have said it very quietly since none of the ""big"" news services seem to be reporting it.  I wouldn't get too excited until this becomes a more widely disseminated headline.

FWIW:  I don't see anything on the CDC website that lets nicotine e-cigs off the hook.  ([This article](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html) is dated September 27th)"
daxycw*Good news!*Black market cannabis vaping not cannabis vaping.
daxycw*Good news!*"I tried to send the CDC a note, well, noting that another emergent product I see everywhere is preloaded CBD vape pens that use as the carrier... MCT oil. Like that won't give you lipid pneumonia. Vaping oil. They're all over the place. And people who use them probably won't test positive for THC. It's a bit naive of the CDC to assume people will just 'fess up to buying and using black-market THC carts. Especially where THC carts are illegal, period. I hope they tested the people claiming they only vaped nicotine for THC. I'm not sure if they have that authority. But, really, who volunteers to a bunch of federal investigators they've been using a federally-illegal drug bought out of the back of a truck. Especially when they know the next question is absolutely going to be, ""Who/where did you buy them from?"" because the CDC has to trace the supply chain?

Also, people have been vaping e-liquid for 15 years now.  Why a sudden outbreak now of up-to-lethal lung disease? Nothing has changed about e-liquid's basic ingredients to trigger a sudden epidemic. Why no epidemic in Great Britain, where vape shops are opening in hospital lobbies? (However you feel about government-supplied healthcare for all citizens (or residents, or whoever can use the NHS's services) is that when a country's elected government has to pay for everybody's health problems, they are a lot more willing to fund research--and listen to it--into the actual-public health utility of vaping to get people off cigarettes. Smokers die slowly of it and get sick from non-lethal chronic illnesses before half or 2/3 of them die of it. The government has to pay the enormous cost of their collective illnesses and hospitalizations for pneumonia and heart attacks and all the nasty stuff cigarettes cause in regular smokers. No tobacco lobby can pay the government off anywhere near enough to cover the price it pays in extra healthcare, lost productivity, etc. Which comes out of every taxpayers' pockets. They'll get voted out of office if the NHS gets overburdened with preventable illnesses, so they do try to prevent them. Though I don't think any democracy has the ability to ban cigarettes; people seem to feel entitled to the things; but they can recommend vaping as a much safer alternative when Johnny Smoker gets his first cloudy lung x-ray.)

I did a fellowship at the CDC, and they're actually good people. But they are used to epidemics being caused by viruses or contaminated food or something that only sickened, say, people staying in one particular hotel. (That was a real case they solved. Turned out to be contaminants spread via the hotel's HVAC system, i believe.) Anyway, the scientists are middle-age-ish and live in Atlanta; they are NOT prepared for an epidemic caused by a change in thickeners used to make thinned-out (cut) THC oil look right again. I doubt they read Leafly articles. A ton of catching up to do on what people vape, how, and even that the typical cartridge battery + THC (or CBD) cartridge is not how people vape e-liquid. As for Juul pod systems, i wouldn't quite put it past Philip Morris to adulterate e-liquid pods on purpose to kill off the e-cigarette industry. No I have no evidence and yeah that seems like a stretch; but, really, we're talking about people whose main product causes 1 in 5 American deaths. And was deliberately made much more addictive than plain nicotine. Are they willing to kill people? Uh, well, considering they are in the coffin-nail, death-stick industry that serves no legitimate need, obviously yes. Mind you, I'm not claiming they did any such thing. just meditating on their collective mindset based on the indisputable fact that their products uselessly kill their customers, they know it, and they made it as hard as possible for the latter to quit using their products. No more captive a customer base than people literally addicted to what they make and peddle."
daxycw*Good news!*"""Now that we've completely destroyed the e-cig market....""

3hl1xq*England Officially Announces Support For Vaping*"That's awesome.

I hate how most countries are like ""oh shit, there are no studies saying it's bad.... But ehhh let's fucking ban it anyway! And treat it exactly like we do cigarettes even though they're completely different things, because we're lazy fucks!!""

It's absolutely ridiculous "
3hl1xq*England Officially Announces Support For Vaping*"I am not sure if this has been said. I quickly scrolled through the comments but nothing too obvious stood out. 
The fundamental difference between The UK and California and the rest of the states) at the moment regarding vaping. 
In the UK, health care if free. Simple as that, the governments and  this tool of a politician Mark Leno all know this. That vaping is by far better for people than smoking. The UK knows that they would have to spend a lot more on smoking related illnesses in the future compared to vaping related illnesses if any. Where as in the states, we all know the arguments are supported by the tabacco, medical insurance, and pharmaceutical companies. So they would lose out on a huge amount of money. So there it is simply. Everyone knows the benefits to peoples health. But what really is driving the opposition is the money. If the UK didn't have the NHS (National Health Service) We'd all still be in the same boat being captained by twats like Mark Leno."
3hl1xq*England Officially Announces Support For Vaping*"Oh god, it's gonna be the New Year's Noobie Wave all over again.
Which is a good thing!

*Please use the goddamned sidebar*"
3hl1xq*England Officially Announces Support For Vaping*"There's been a lot of news regarding the uk now supporting vaping due to the news about it being 95% safer than smoking and i'm not as thrilled as most people are.
I believe this was the governments plan all along.
step one
Ruin and dismantle the image of vaping via numerous ""studies"" and articles over the last couple of years slating vaping saying its bad for you. . step two
put into place regulations regarding how and what we use (which just so happens to stop the sale of 99% of the ecigs we all use, unless we change this article 20 will be enforced next year. 
step three:
build back up the reputation of vaping in time for article 20 to hit. leaving people with only one option, buy cigalikes from big pharma/big tobacco, make it available on prescriptions and tax the hell out of it thus reducing the deficit that switching to vaping has caused. 
Step four:
Cash in"
3hl1xq*England Officially Announces Support For Vaping*Well I hope Canada follows. 
3hl1xq*England Officially Announces Support For Vaping*"I've been vaping for over six (6) years, after smoking for forty-five (45) years.  It only took me one (1) month of experimenting to find the right device, and I quit burning tobacco on 8/8/2009.

I've read about all the negative reviews and anti-vaping legislation all over my country these past six (6) years; and have followed all the scientific studies showing the benefits of Tobacco Harm Reduction,  It's refreshing to see a government finally listening to the actual SCIENCE as opposed to the hype generated by Big Tobacco!! "
3hl1xq*England Officially Announces Support For Vaping*Awesome progress!
3hl1xq*England Officially Announces Support For Vaping*This is a huge step, an important one, but not the end of the challenges ahead.

I'm one of those men who goes into a store with a battle plan. I know what I want, I know how much it costs and I have my VISA ready to go before I even get to the register. I've never ""hung out"" in a store ... it's a totally foreign concept to me.

4dbjzj*How I came to owe a blowjob to Paramount Vapor*Well, you kinda set a low bar for that one.
4dbjzj*How I came to owe a blowjob to Paramount Vapor*"So I first heard about Paramount Vapor 2 years ago over Black Friday. Wasn't a fan of the juice I got, and the shipping took a month, but it was cheap. The next flavor I tried from them was ""mellow mango,"" which is the greatest flavor of all time. This guys sells these 120ml bottles for $20 and always ships on time now. It's the best budget juice that doesn't taste like budget juice. Period. Mellow mango has been sold out for months and I've substituted their flavor ""Merica"" (great flavor), but I miss mellow mango so much. I opened up the mail today to find a free 120ml of mellow mango alongside my merica. I've never been happier. Anyway, I felt the need to post a shout out for this fucking awesome vendor."
4dbjzj*How I came to owe a blowjob to Paramount Vapor*"that's basically a free bj for them, what does it really cost for them to make that 120ml? 3$. 
You're cheaper than a grimy craigslist bj! 

This is definitely funny tho, haha!"
4dbjzj*How I came to owe a blowjob to Paramount Vapor*"Man you got lucky, you didn't specify how much.  At least they're giving you 120ml for that bj.  Could have just been a 15ml

But, looks like Mellow Mango is back in stock, so for all you who have been waiting (it's been out quite a bit lately), thank /u/HashtagYoloSwag, he/she's truly taking one for the team.

Edit: On an entirely unrelated note, thanks so much for posting this!  Made me check the site, and I see there's a sale.  Make sure that BJ is legendary, maybe they'll have a 120ml for $10 sale next."
4dbjzj*How I came to owe a blowjob to Paramount Vapor*I'm not gay, but mellow mango is mellow mango.
4dbjzj*How I came to owe a blowjob to Paramount Vapor*Nobody has offered me a blowjob for juice :(
4dbjzj*How I came to owe a blowjob to Paramount Vapor*Man, these guys are legit. I bought a 120ml once and asked if I could get a sample of the mellow mango (I asked for a 5ml lol), and they sent me an entire 120ml of mellow mango. <3
4dbjzj*How I came to owe a blowjob to Paramount Vapor*"OP, I decided to order with a little love note...

Of course now I'm on an Atlantis with a Sig 100w (overkill, yes I know). 

This coming from someone who did try:

I get it, big clouds are neat. But I feel like a tool if I take my iTaste thing out in public, it's huge. I'd love to see more low profile devices. When I'm out I carry two Mini Protank 2's with a P1312/P1309, they're slim, easy to carry, and I still get medium sized clouds if I want. Nobody stares at me, non-smoking bars don't mind me puffing, etc.
When you're holding a giant cannon and fogging up the place, non-smokers and cigarette smokers think you're a douche. The exception would be a total smoker bar/dive, and even then, the giant mods just look silly in public, regardless of how great they may be. A Mini Protank will easily last me a few days, so I'm really hoping that somebody like Kayfun or Aspire will put out mini-tanks with rebuildable quality for those who have no interest in dripping or making custom coils.

349pjm*To me, this hit the nail right on the head.*Trying to convince my SO's friend group (all late 20s well off smokers) to give vaping a chance. They smoke heavily and my SO is quitting. But whenever it comes up it turns into a big hate fest on ecigs. How they don't give you a buzz etc etc. I tried to explain that the rigs give you more freedom to choose how much nicotine goes in you and why wouldn't you want to be in control of that?

I had my reservations about the lack of real research on the physiological effects. 
But the difference between levels of cancer causing compounds in cigarettes vs ecigs won me over. 

In the last year I've made the switch and have slowly been lowering my nicotine levels. I'm at 18mgs now and smoking with my voltage at the lowest level (as I've read that the higher levels lead to formaldehyde production) and honestly I feel better than ever. Big pharma & big tobacco is pushing against it, but honestly the best I can do is inform my friends and family on the positive effects I've experienced and refer them to research articles if they're truly interested. 

Tldr: fuck big pharma and tobacco. I'll keep talking about the issue and sharing the facts. I'm a vaper and staying that way. "

2hgrcz*Big tobacco has officially lost its hold on the e-cigarette market. For the first time ever, nic juice/vape sales outpace cigalikes*">“In addition to the experience provided through them, open system vaporizers are also a lower-cost vaping option over the long-term,"" Bonnie Herzog, an analyst who worked on the paper, said in an emailed statement. ""We have found, for instance, that the weekly spend for an open system user is about 30 percent less than that of an e-cigarette user.”

Yep. Hence the 120 page letter RJR wrote to the FDA encouraging banning of these ""open"" systems.

I mean come on, if your average joe in the street and Wells god damn Fargo agree on the inevitable direction (as evidenced by the profitability) of the industry, it has to be pretty clear overall right? What kind of fucked up shit will it take for the FDA to come down squarely on the side of Big T?

I swear to god if the FDA decide to regulate open systems in US shops over hollow cries of ""safety"" and ""quality control"", there will be a MASS exodus of products from the USA, the EU and China will step in to fill the gap and we're actually reaching amounts of money now that the government as a whole cannot afford to ignore for the sake of the economy.

I live in the UK and, chances are, we won't turn out to be any more sensible about the whole damn thing, especially if the Americans lead the way, but fuck me if I won't buy every god damn clone, battery, RDA and bottle of juice I can get my grubby little hands on before that time comes.

2hgrcz*Big tobacco has officially lost its hold on the e-cigarette market. For the first time ever, nic juice/vape sales outpace cigalikes*"There is this gap in vaping. It is the Vaping Gap.

This gap is in hardware, and ability. Not everyone is going to rebuild coils, Ego's are where people start, rebuildables are leaps and bounds over any CE4 or whatever starter/cigalike people use. 

It sucks, but until there is a readily available, SUPERB, safe, and maintenance-free experience, there are quite a few people that will plateau at shit-performing hardware and go right back to the nails.

And for what it's worth, those mass-produced, BT backed (but unbranded and ""affiliated"") cigalikes DO bring a lot of people into the vape side."

3k00m8*How to effectively wick an RDA to last 20+ hits without going dry, no temp control or fancy build needed. With demonstration and tutorial.*"Thanks a ton! This works really well. After seeing the video I rewicked my velocity.
I used about this much cotton http://i.imgur.com/u5kYV4Q.jpg (Pic is from the left overs, I covered up some of it so only the visible part is how much I used.)
Using the whole pad seemed a bit excessive and probably would've not fit in the velocity.
And this is what it looks like after maybe 20 hits http://i.imgur.com/FFrvNUW.jpg

3mm bore, 24g kanthal, 8 wraps at 0.3 ohm. Vaped at 50W non-stop until it started to taste cottony/starchy/potato-ish. Didn't get a burnt taste at all. Just more and more starchy/potato flavor. Which is great since usually when I get a slight burnt taste and don't rejuice immediately the next hit is completely burnt. With this I vaped maybe 5 or 6 more times when it tasted dry the first time.

My guess why this works is that since the cotton is so tight inside the coil there's very little air and oxygen to start a combustion process. So the cotton just heats up but doesn't burn (might explain the starchy taste). Also the massive amount of cotton on the outside helps to draw more liquid into the coil."
3k00m8*How to effectively wick an RDA to last 20+ hits without going dry, no temp control or fancy build needed.

So amazing that I sat vaping for 20 minutes taking the odd hit, was still getting a little flavor although it was muted. I looked at my wicks and they were bone dry, fluffy white cotton and no burnt hits.

No burnt hits while vaping dry cotton at 80 watts.

Thanks a lot, OP. This is awesome."

A vaporizer is a tobacco product, because it is a component of a tobacco product. People use it to vaporize nicotine containing eliquid.  Any other liquid that is designed to be put in a vaporizer is also a tobacco product, because it's being used in a tobacco product.

1y3pt0*UPDATE on Tennessee bill to PROTECT E-Cigs & vapor products from tobacco taxation & regulation!! (PLEASE UPVOTE for visibility, & READ!! THIS BILL NEEDS OUR HELP!!)*maybe i missed something... i really dont have any issue with e-cigs being treated like tobacco products for taxation and laws. i think under 18's should be able to have it and i think it makes sense in large part because it is a source of nicotine and the tobacco industry is essential to the nicotine content. why would this regulation be a problem for a legitimate and well made product? if e-cigs are regulated as a tobacco product then they cannot be banned without them having to ban cigarettes too.

3bnb2a*"When ""broke"" redditors beg for free juice to ""keep them from going back to smoking"", I wonder..."*"If you have time to wait in somebody to ship you juice you obviously have time to order some so...

 Step 1.  Scrape up a few bucks for a bottle of cheap juice online,  like mechsauce cheap. 

Step 2. Before checking out add ALL the flavor shots. And get it with higher PG % and a higher nic strength than you vape at. (I vape 3 so I bought 18)

Step 3. Buy USP VG at the pharmacy for another a few dollars and cut accordingly to get your preferred nicotine level. 

This will get you through til you have some more money I've had to do it myself"
3bnb2a*"When ""broke"" redditors beg for free juice to ""keep them from going back to smoking"", I wonder..."*"YES!

And those that say, ""Give me juice or I will smoke"" my first thought always is, go smoke then.  It's your life."
3bnb2a*"When ""broke"" redditors beg for free juice to ""keep them from going back to smoking"", I wonder..."*"Right, you can get some nicotine and vg for like $30 and vape for a month at least.  

Edit:
I wanted to check and see what I could get real quickly.  I only checked MFS.  $11 gets 500 mil of VG, $18 gets 125 mil of 100mg nic base plus $6 shipping is $35.  Lets say you vape 15mil per day of 6mg(for 500 mil thats only 30 mil of the nic base so you have 95 mil left for later) you could vape that 530 mil for 35 days.  Then you just buy another liter of VG for $17 plus $6 shipping and vape for another 70 days.  Of course you will have to spend like $10 on a large bottle and a couple syringes.  So you could vape for three months for about $70.  Where I live thats 10 packs of smokes.  Half a pack a day and you get 20 days.

Im not real sure why i have taken the time to do all that.  I now realize no one will read this and if they do they will just tell me how im wrong.  Fuck it."

2w7st6*ecig.com | North Dakota Passes Bill To Not Classify ECigs as Tobacco Products.*"And yet also in ND, Senate Bill 2322 is making it's way through - which adds ecigs under the OTP definition and adds/increases taxes on all tobacco products.  

http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/64-2015/documents/15-0769-04000.pdf?20150217164642

The fiscal note on this one: Section 1 of engrossed SB 2322 changes the definition of 'other tobacco products' to include e-cigarettes and
components. Section 2 of engrossed SB 2322 increases the tobacco excise tax rates: (1) from 28% to 50% of the
wholesale purchases price on other tobacco products, (2) from $.60 to $2.72 per ounce for snuff, and (3) from $.16
to $.73 per ounce for chewing tobacco. Section 5 of engrossed SB 2322 increases the tax from $.44 to $2.00 per
package of 20 cigarettes. If enacted, these tax increases are expected to increase total cigarette and tobacco tax
revenue by an estimated $175.127 million in the 2015-17 biennium. This estimate assumes a drop in cigarette
consumption of approximately 16% and a drop in consumption of other tobacco products of 15%.    
E-cigs and their components are not included in this fiscal note as consumption and wholesale cost information is
not available at this time.

It also adds a conspiracy spin that really just doesn't exist (at least not in this case) with the ""Bill stuffing"" comment.  The bill passed was to restrict sales of ""nicotine devices"" to minors (great news).  As with any bill that introduces new language into the statues, it has to define what a ""nicotine device"" actually is.

>The third bill, HB1078, passed 51-40.Introduced by Rep. Diane Larson, R-Bismarck, it makes it illegal for minors to use or be sold “nicotine devices.”

>The bill defines nicotine devices as “any noncombustible product that can be used by an individual to simulate smoking through inhalation of a substance that contains or delivers nicotine or any other ingredient.”

dd4mqk*New Study: Not One Vaping Illness Linked To Legal E-Cigarette Pods*The real end game is leaving us with nothing but pods. Easier to tax.
dd4mqk*New Study: Not One Vaping Illness Linked To Legal E-Cigarette Pods*They can't ignore the facts anymore. Plus, I was thinking, they say we need to ban flavored ejuice, but isn't tobacco a flavor? Also, if they sent a poll out to the people who are struggling economically, how important would those citizens consider controversy over flavored ejuice? Our country needs to spend more time on improving communication skills, stable home environments, and attending to our children's emotional and physical needs. What's really important?
dd4mqk*New Study: Not One Vaping Illness Linked To Legal E-Cigarette Pods*"So I read the whole damn paper. All it says is 'we don't know' and that the one common thread between the cases (foamy microphages) is an occurrence normally found with drug or chemical exposer. It then goes on to say that this could be an issue from open tank systems due to ""limitless chemical combinations"" that could arise from using multiple juices. 

Stop reading headlines and opinion pieces and read the papers themselves. This isn't a win, this isn't really anything other than them shrugging their shoulders and saying 'kinda sorta maybe'"

dd4mqk*New Study: Not One Vaping Illness Linked To Legal E-Cigarette Pods*"This is what it says     

     ""Vaping products, particularly the open access 
tank style vaporizers, allow the user to aerosolize essentially limitless combinations of chemicals

these reasons, we cannot exclude a dose-dependent toxicity of one or more compounds."" 

It also says that vaping THC was ""notable"" and it could be ""playing an important role"""
dd4mqk*New Study: Not One Vaping Illness Linked To Legal E-Cigarette Pods*I thought none were actually approved by the FDA?

With their strong ties to China in regards to trade and import/export, I'm sure they were first on the list for any future e-cigarette products. And since their entire standing army also serves as farmer help during the harvesting season, they could easily stop food production (since they get free food from the UN and South Korea) and start producing their own tobacco for extracting nicotine to make their own DPRK line of juice such as Soju flavor, ""tears of the puppet master"" (my personal favorite), and ""hammer and sickle""."

3z37wx*This is bad guys*"**IF THIS IS CONSIDERED WITCH HUNTING, PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND I WILL REMOVE THE NAME OF THE COMPANY. THANK YOU.**

&nbsp;

To start, I do not have any affiliation with Vapeola or GrandVapor nor do I have any sort of affiliation with their direct or indirect competitors. I am writing solely this as a concerned community member. I'm posting this from my other comment because it looks like the company is trying to do some damage control. Judging by how they respond to customers and the vaping community, I predict they will lie about their responses or chosen words. As someone who works in the industry and consider myself part of the community, I do not believe anyone would want dishonest vendors. I did not notice this until a few hours ago so I missed a bunch, but here is what I have so far.

Obviously I over estimated the thought process of many facebook people and actually spoke with a woman for a moment and in short we are jumping forward on the marketing list. I am not sure we are ready to expose all the plans for the line but they are actually very Kid friendly and it may suck having to take the bashing today but for the greater good it was well worth it. SiNVape if there is a way tp message me on here feel free to I will get in the loop on the entire plan for the line.

**EDIT 2:** It looks like they're being real shitty on Instagram too. Will provide quotes and responses. If this counts as witchunting, please let me know and I will delete them.

With sirwilltheasshole:

>**sirwilltheasshole** The label is stupid why make it looks like a child's toy this makes me want to go back to smoking
>
>**grandvapors** @sirwilltheasshole You should repost this and share how you feel with the world. I find it funny this was designed to release the inner child and yet it makes you want to smoke. At what age did you start like 6 years old? But I am still glad you quit and started vaping. WE all do it for the kids if we have no other reason.

&nbsp;

With madvaporerz:

>**madvaporerz** It is clear that this brand is marketed towrds children. The vaping community is in an uproar, & we will not stop posting on all social media platforms until you rebrand.
>
>**grandvapors** @madvaporerz Is that a promise?

&nbsp;

With loq_on:

>**loq_on** I'd apologize right now & remarket everything asap cause if not the community is gonna fuckin destroy you fast as fuck. This shit is gonna spread like wild fire & not in a good way for you
>
>**grandvapors** @loq_on good thing we are not you. If we were we would be promoting bullying. Just because I do not like Mc Donalds does not make me go bitch at them when I should be spending times raising my kids. Think and then comment.
>
>**loq_on** @grandvapors actually you are the one's tryin to bully the entire community by going against us standing together. And thinking that your way is ok & righteous when meanwhile all you are trying to do is hold us hostage to your petty marketing scheme. You a special kind of stupid if you don't realize this.
>
>**grandvapors** Wait if you do not want to watch Gay porn do you walk in and sit down and bitch? No you get up and walk out. Well unless you are in to that. This stands true here. Hostage? I did not direct you to this page. I did not even ask you to stop by. I am guessing a couple people bitching and 226 likes is the majority speaking.

>***Overnight. loq_on seemes to have been proven correct.**
>
>**loq_on** Hahahaha, the entire fukn vape community hates you with a bloody passion!! Great job you're super smart. There are people out there who are gonna do everything in their power to see that you go out of business. No one wants you in vaping. Shit's gonna go real bad for you, you fukn moron

&nbsp;

**EDIT 3:** It looks like their website is a basic GoDaddy website as well. I think there is some concern as they paid for their SSL and security but did not bother activating it so their website is still unsecure.

&nbsp;

**EDIT 4:** One of the GrandVapor locations will be leaving GrandVapors' franchise and will be changing the name of the store to their own store because of this shit show. Jon, the owner of the other location expressed clearly that him and his team do not agree with GrandVapor and this situation. Jon is livid that he is forced to do this, but it is for the better. I wish Jon, previously of a GrandVapors store, the best of luck and for doing the right thing!

&nbsp;

**EDIT 5:** This edit is in relation to Edit 4. Here is the owner of GrandVapors failing pretty bad at smearing the name of Jons' store with a snarky response to a bad review of Vapeola and GrandVapor. He posts with his personal Facebook as well as Jons' stores' Facebook with the exact same content. The red is the owner of GrandVapors, the green is Jons' store location, and the white is the review poster. I am censoring the store location due to the amount of people who may just see the image without reading and flame that page. Same reason for the owner.

3z37wx*This is bad guys*I'm sure this comment will get downvoted to the nether regions of this post. However, this post has gotten the company more publicity and brand awareness, increased followers on Facebook, and I am sure a few orders from people who never heard of them before. I've noticed more than a few companies out there who would relish the bad boy publicity, and this company is one of them. Perhaps that is the reason all their adverts and branding is like this. They get such a rise out of people who continuously talk about them.

Now, to be that guy, while I think these results are great, I think it would be interesting to see what the spectrometer would see in aresolized vapor.

2q79g4*Just saw this on Twitter and gagged a little.*"Ill never forget when i was about 9 years old at my grandfather's house while my mom was cleaning for him. 

He had been a smoker since he was twelve years old, 2 packs a day for the most part. In his old age he didnt have much mobility, so he spent his days sitting in his lazyboy reading and lighting smokes of the lit end of other smokes. (fucked that the colon cancer got him before lung complications).

We were cleaning the house for the first time in about 2-3 years when my mom got around to the wall behind his chair, there was a small painting of a sailboat on the wall and when she moved it while dusting, the wall behind was WHITE. Like porcelain white in comparison. I had always thought growing up that his walls were just a strange dark yellow color. NOPE.

I watched my mom touch a sponge to the wall and it dripped almost black goo. It was sticky as well. If you stuck your finger in soap you could have written your fucking name in it. 

Shit was nasty."
2q79g4*Just saw this on Twitter and gagged a little.*I can't hate on that, it was a good jab. Pretty funny.
2q79g4*Just saw this on Twitter and gagged a little.*Good news! Cigarette juice!
2q79g4*Just saw this on Twitter and gagged a little.*"My parents smoked at least a pack a day each for well over 35 years in their house. When I would come home from college, I would always wipe off the tv, it was a glass tube, with windex. Yeuck. 

When they both passed, I had to fix the house to sell it. No kidding, I went through 15 gallons of Kilz paint on the sheetrock. I would cover the wall, and when I came back the next day, the oil was seeping through. Luckily, most of the non-bedroom spaces were paneled. We ripped those sticky, nasty things off the wall. 

Everything was ruined. All of their books were brown and sticky on the spines but white on the face and back. No one wanted them, and they still stink up my attic. I had to chunk all the furniture. I tried to save all the wood furniture, but even after everything TSP, various alcohols, months in the sun, they reeked too much for my house or to sell. Their china made it: brown to bone white.

My best friend wanted their brown writing desk. I waited until she showed up with a truck, and then took the books out of the shelves. Behind the books, and everywhere sealed away from smoke, was bright 70's avocado green."

_______________
To whom it may concern,

Recently an image of a billboard(in location) owned by your organization has been making its rounds across Reddit and other areas of the web that are of interest to users of Electronic Vaporizers (E-cigs, Vapers, etc).  Your billboard lists a few chemicals that you claim that the vapor produced by E-cigs contains.  This list is that of false claims and inaccurate representation of the actual chemical works of E-cig vapor, as well as libel disguised as anti-vaping propaganda and a false ""health ad"".


Let us start off with the first you have listed, Proplyene glycol. Immediately you should notice that it is spelled incorrectly.  The correct spelling of the chemical is Propylene Glycol. Propylene Glycol, or PG is an organic compound that is used in E-cigarette liquid as well as numerous food additives. It is used in food items such as Ice cream, soda, whipped cream, and others as a sweetening agent.  In the medical field it is used as a solvent in order to deliver  medication such as those contained in Asthma Inhalers, Diazepam (aka Valium) and Lorazepam (aka Ativan). Drugs that many people need on a day to day basis in order to live normal healthy lives.


Formaldehyde. While nothing positive can be said about formaldehyde, other than it helps your loved ones look good during funerals and wakes, it is a naturally occurring, organic compound just like everything else you claim is in E-cig vapor.  While it has been found in trace amounts in the vapor of certain setups, the 99% majority will never come into contact with formaldehyde while using a vaping product.  As for those who do end up inhaling formaldehyde while using a vaping device, there is a problem with either A: The device, B: The liquid, C: The amount of knowledge the person has, or D: Any combination of those 3. Much like water, formaldehyde is toxic and can kill you if you aren't careful and knowledgeable about what it is and how it's toxic.  For it to appear in vaping products the PG(Propylene glycol) and VG(Vegetable glycerin) is being overheated past the point of safe usage and thus creates  chemicals that it shouldn't.


Next, let's look at Benzene. Benzene is also an organic compound that is A: A petrochemical, B: A Hydrocarbon, and C: Derived from the distillation of Benzoic Acid, which is a food preservative and also in various medications. In order for Benzene to exist in E-cigarette vapor, the liquid itself would have to contain Petroleum(or any petrol product) or benzoic acid, of which, it contains neither. Benzoic Acid is used as a food preservative to inhibit the growth of mold, yeast, and bacteria. Three things that spoil food and can very well cause severe illness in certain people. Isoprene is the last chemical that your billboard listed by name. 

Isoprene, like all the others, is an organic compound that is produced and emitted by various forms of plant life, bacteria, and is even found in the breath of Human beings. The amount of Isoprene found naturally in the atmosphere would be enough to kill every human on the planet, if it were toxic as your billboard states it is. It is also used in biological processes and medicine to create, among other things: Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and Phytol which is used to make synthetic forms of Vitamins E and K1.


Now this letter does not state, at any point, that vaping is 100% safe or 100% healthy. It IS, however, safer and healthier than smoking a standard cigarette or cigar. Both of those use combustion in order to produce smoke, which,at its core, is microscopic ash particles, liquids, and gases that contain more than 100x times the amount of different chemicals found in the liquid and vapor of E-Cig products. Sure there is a lack of study data on the long term effects of vaping, but that is only linked to the fact that it is still a relatively new thing. Tobacco usage has been going on for centuries in one form or another. None of the information above is further than a Google and Wikipedia search away.  I as a vaper, and the vaping community at large ask you do research before spreading false information like you have done by erecting this billboard. The vast majority of us are using this as a method to free ourselves from traditional cigarettes, get ourselves off of nicotine, and to better our situation in reference to our over all health. Many of us, including myself, have succeeded in this regard.

Thank you.

2i7id8*"****FRAUD ALERT**** PLEASE UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY"*This is very, very common for online retailers. once you ship something to a scammers forwarder address, you go on a list of easy targets and get hit hard. Make sure your processor has AVS match turned on and restrict orders with a different shipping address to billing address, ask customers to contact you if they require a different shipping address. between your merchant backend and your cart software you can be reasonably protected from this - any big ticket orders ALWAYS call the customer and confirm the details etc before shipping - most scammers use random numbers that never get answered. Been dealing with this creditcard fraud through soft target ecomerce for years and it's horrible the damage it can do to small business.

It's been being used for [some time.](http://www.cpfmarketplace.com/mp/showthread.php?267046-*Fraud-Alert*-Attention-All-DEALERS-*Fraud-Alert*) 

How this usually works is someone who doesn't reside at the residence, pays the owner to receive packages under different names. They sign for the package and then the scammer will come and pick it up, paying the fee for using the location. This way, if the police ever arrive, the owner of the home has no connection to the the item and it looks like it just an attempt to intercept the package.

2i7id8*"****FRAUD ALERT**** PLEASE UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY"*I work for a big company, not even related to ecigs, and we dont ever ship anything to places in FL with Suite Numbers. Its almost always a scammer. If it isnt, we ask for another payment method and address.

5ic6je*Trump urged to snuff out FDA rules threatening 15,000 e-cig makers*"I wouldn't hold my breath on this one but If we do wan't change then be vocal. Keep in mind how the political game works. Check out CGP Grey's video on [Rules for Rulers](https://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs) but essentially each politician has keys to power. For him to side against the FDA it would mean that he has more to gain from going against big tobacco. Yes job's will be lost but that's also less job's being lost from big tobacco in the US. The one thing the vape industry has over big tobbacco though is the fact vapers care about vaping laws. People who smoke cigarettes themselves would not consider themselves team big tobbacco but vapers are team E-cig makers so even if Trump does nothing still be vocal.


The best example I could draw up right now is marijuana laws. The DEA, prisons, pharmaceutical companies, and etc are making a lot of money keeping marijuana illegal and almost undoubtedly help fund and back candidates who will do so.

Candidate A could go pro legalization but now they lost the potential gains from people wanting to keep it illegal and worse, that support will  be thrown to candidate B.

However now that marijuana legalization is a more important issue to a growing amount of people the support and gains that a candidate can get for being pro legalization will start out weighing the gains from being against it. This causes the old key of power to be replaced by the newer better one.

Sorry if this didn't make much sense, I haven't slept in over 24 hours due to finals but I strongly recommend watching the CGP grey video as it does a great job explaining why people in power can't just pick the more noble option. "

5bfn40*Vapor passes the AMES test: unlike tobacco smoke, vapor does NOT seem to induce genetic mutation in cells (British American Tobacco Co. funded study on one of their products)*I'm suprised a study funded by a tobacco company came out against tobacco, good integrity on those running the study
5bfn40*Vapor passes the AMES test: unlike tobacco smoke, vapor does NOT seem to induce genetic mutation in cells (British American Tobacco Co. funded study on one of their products)*Awesome! Keep the good studies coming from the U.K.  We know that the US is way behind and ready to vilify vaping.  
5bfn40*Vapor passes the AMES test: unlike tobacco smoke, vapor does NOT seem to induce genetic mutation in cells (British American Tobacco Co. funded study on one of their products)*The tobacco industry is looking to get into E-cig sales.

5bfn40*Vapor passes the AMES test: unlike tobacco smoke, vapor does NOT seem to induce genetic mutation in cells (British American Tobacco Co. funded study on one of their products)*Just means Tobacco has decided the jump to e-cigs will be a profitable venture in the long-run.

Big pharma making eliquid, big tobacco releasing vape products like vuse. Anything to make a dollar  
5bfn40*Vapor passes the AMES test: unlike tobacco smoke, vapor does NOT seem to induce genetic mutation in cells (British American Tobacco Co. funded study on one of their products)* Iirc there was a study a few months back that said the opposite,regardless of the studies I'm just gonna go with what my body doesn't react horribly to.

4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*I find that easy to believe in big cities like NYC, LA, Chicago, SF, Seattle. The air in some cities may even be worse than vaporizers.

4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*"TLDR; an actually reputable scientific journal, actually peer reviewed, shows no short term effects from e cigs.  More studies will be needed, on a greater variety of gear and flavors, but this is a great start.

Note: This doesn't mean there wont be any long term effects, but most long term effects from smoking do have short term indicators. So this at least makes long term effects *less likely*."
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*New! July 18th 2015.
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*[deleted]
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*I just have to say I find this very unlikely.
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*"This news has been out for many months already but this article might be new .

About as useful as all the other e cig articles out there in reality .

A 6 hour test and conclusion lol.  Fact is it will be a long time until any worthwhile studies come out.

I think we are all sick of hearing about these studies , just vape and be happy."
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*"Study might carry more weight if NOT sponsored by BAT.
It is interesting though, I thought similar studys have been done before and showed some damage, just nowhere near cigarette amounts.
"
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*This is the second time this study has been posted, its a couple months old. Its kind of important to note that its published by British American Tobacco. So make of it what you will, but the results seem accurate if you read the actual paper.
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*This has been on here before. And unless you're in a massive city, I just can't believe it. Your lungs aren't really meant for anything but oxygen, anything else put in them, will of course, do some harm. Although I believe ecigs aren't that bad for you, they still aren't on par with oxygen 
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*"Interesting study! Awesome to hear. I live on the water though, so my air is pretty clean.
"
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*That's some interest finding
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*It seems like nicotine isn't the issue its the smoking or what looks like smoking thats the issue.   Why cant they see that vaping just isnt the same? Cause smoke or a smoke like thing is coming out?
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*Air from China or from the Grand Canyon? 
4c24ho*New Study Reveals E-Cigarette Vapor No More Dangerous Than Air*"That's consistent with [this study that directly compared vapor with air blanks](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230014002505) and found similar levels of harmful and potentially harmful compounds. Cigarettes were used as a control. Granted, it's a Lorillard study, but the method looks solid. I've seen other studies that look at aldehydes in ambient air in big cities and compared with separate studies of aldehyde content in e-cig vapor, the aldehyde levels are comperable.

I'm sure there's more science to do, and yes, ""OMG vapor is just like air, bro!"" sounds hyperbolic, but in heavily populated areas, the studies seem to suggest that in terms of harmful compounds, it may be close to the mark."

46xu4q*NY judge says vaping is NOT smoking*A win is a win, no matter how small!
46xu4q*NY judge says vaping is NOT smoking*"> After all, vapor devices just do not match up with the state’s current definition of “smoking” and cannot be treated as tobacco products if they contain no tobacco.

Good lord someone finally saw the freakin' light!  How many bureaucrats did it take to make some goddamn sense about how to label e-cigarettes.  That is the part of this ordeal that annoys me most, just the casual lumping of ecigs into the tobacco category, simply because some of us still get nicotine from them. "

46xu4q*NY judge says vaping is NOT smoking*This means nothing. In fact, all it means is that the state will spitefully pass specific laws dealing with eCigs, possibly banning them completely, and certainly taxing them unreasonably if not.
2266f5*Don't be this guy. Please. Especially in public places where you wouldn't have normally smoked in the past.*The only place I vape where smoking isn't normally allowed is in a bar. And then I ask the bartender if they mind if I vape first. I've noticed most bars don't really mind.

2266f5*Don't be this guy. Please. Especially in public places where you wouldn't have normally smoked in the past.*At work, about 9 people have switched from analogs to vaping. We all agreed to vape only outside or in the warehouse when customers weren't around. This was the gentlemans agreement and no one had a problem with it. One day, an office coworker who had just recently switched to vaping decided he would do it at his desk. The VP of the company saw the clouds and it was bye bye vaping inside for all of us.

>We all know that smoking is bad for your health, but what about you or your organisations security? I'll show you that an eCig isn't just a glorified smoke machine but a low power, battery operated, exploitation platform. I'll show you how easy it is to decrypt the firmware, write your own functionality and use this to pwn some systems. Turning your eCig into everything from a keyboard to a USB stick.

I personally have used innocuous looking devices to perform attack scenarios for my clients. I made an attack device looks like a thermostat, reads out the current temp and humidity to a LCD panel, but contained a separate chipset in there that had an oDroid that was loaded with linux and some tools I used to compromise the clients network from off site.

4k6bgh*Premium Labs threatened to sue my workplace because I asked for lab tests and I lost my job.*"Id call a lawyer immediately and sue for wrongful termination

Edit:noticed youre in canada, a quick lookup of the laws leads me to believe since you didnt violate any workplace procedure they couldnt terminate you without reasonable notice. So they could have said you have ""x"" number of days left here and not been in violation but if that didnt happen they are in the wrong. Also the law says they basically have to pay your unemployment for doing this out of pocket and can not reinstate you."
4k6bgh*Premium Labs threatened to sue my workplace because I asked for lab tests and I lost my job.*"I strongly urge everyone here to email ECTA and ask them to revoke Premium Labs' ""stamp of approval."" It is completely asinine for an organization that prides themselves on transparency to support a company that not only refuses to be transparent but that threatens a small business with litigation if they don't fire an employee for simply asking for lab results. 

I'm never been a proponent of diketone free ejuice or mandatory disclosure but its another thing entirely for a company to claim to be diketone free and then when asked for proof to delete posts and force a company to fire its employees simply for asking for proof that their claims are true. "
4k6bgh*Premium Labs threatened to sue my workplace because I asked for lab tests and I lost my job.*"""Premium Labs contacted my employers and threatened to sue them""

You asked them for something they are by law or policy supposed to provide and they threaten to sue your employer if they didn't not fire you for making this request?

Further, they found out exactly who your employer was by nefarious means and used that against you?

Right now what you should be doing is looking for the best attorney in this particular legal area you can find - spare no cost (sue for attorney fees) - and you should sue both the company and your employer - your employer should also lawyer up and sue for any threats made by the employee of the Lab - immediately!

Litigation used as a form of intimidation that results in you losing your livelihood is a clear violation of your civil rights.

I realize this is Canada, so there are some differences in the law and procedure. However, there are few differences in the civilized world when a job is lost due to litigation as intimidation.

You poked a wasp's nest when you got curious about the public's safety and health and found a bully viper who apparently doesn't understand even the basics of business and law.

If you do not know where to find the best attorney in your area for this violation head over to the university law school and make your way around the departments. You might also wish to find out which politicians lean towards the protection of worker's rights and civil liberties.

If what you say is true, the person who got you fired is about to put the company in jeopardy and could end up doing some time himself. This is a serious violation.

Good Luck


p.s. - if your employer finally figures out how he violated the law, apologizes then offers you your job back, keep this in mind - he may hire you back and later fire you for other reasons. Find a new job, do not go back, report what happen to you to the unemployment board - get it on official record today, right now!

4k6bgh*Premium Labs threatened to sue my workplace because I asked for lab tests and I lost my job.*Sue your former employer and Premium Labs. What they did was illegal. They cannot blackmail someone in order to get you fired. At least at minimum, file a complaint with the labor board.

Sad to hear OP.

From your original thread:

>and I avoid any brands that can't provide a lab test because vaping that stuff causes me severe reactions in my airways and it's not worth the risk. Recovery from a reaction can take a few days normally

I'm aware that some vendors make it known about acetyl propionyl or diacetyl, or anything else that might be harmful in liquids. Hopefully it will become a standard that they link to their results on-site instead of simply posting them on reddit, for actual accountability. I remember that word being a big thing at least a year ago.

Simply saying so in a privacy policy or in a disclaimer isn't enough, but that's just my view."

But thank you for posting this update. I work for a rather large vendor and, from what our distributors tell us, we order more than any other vendors in the United States (2,000 bottles per nicotine level isn't that much is it?). I'm pretty positive we received samples from Premium Labs recently and I will let my bosses know to never order from Premium Labs. I hope everything works out for you!"

It takes me a bit to respond back. This video has been sitting around for a year. I never did get to start my flavor sample videos. I got stuck in my Candy Cane and the Irish Mocha preference. 

I must say my original motivation to posting this video was to share my unique experience. If you looked I mainly post about feeding tube care and user tricks.

I know I am beyond the EVOD experience. 

I tried several flavors. At one time I had a ""bar"" of flavors. 

As the description of the video says, I do use nicotine. 12mg and the blend is PG 50%  and VG 50%. I am not sure if this is the best blend or not. 

The issue with different  flavors is the cleaning the tanks and coils. I have a graveyard of tanks that leak and coils gone bad. I tried to take them apart and recoil but I just don't have the fine motor skills anymore.

I appreciate all the offers for juice, mods, batteries, etc.

A word on Parkinson's Plus Syndromes. Most people see Parkinson's as the shaky, twisting kind. That is an element when the nerves go bad. With Parkinson's Plus, we have many of the traditional Parkinsons and a lot more unseen issues, some have the shaking and twisting most do not. I have tremors that is controlled by medications (ironically not a traditional parkinson's drug.)

2vpge2*Parkinsons victim who can't eat because he is hooked up to a feeding machine uses vaping to experience flavor*"Eating, drinking and vaping are all natural for 21st century homo sapiens.  So even those who can't eat food or drink liquids will still naturally vape to enjoy life.  

Edit: It's not really as complicated as fascists want to make it.  Eating and drinking are supposedly ""deadly"" too, hence the attacks on all sorts of food, calorie starved school kids and the bans on Big Gulps and such.  Vaping is being assaulted on that same level as ""dangerous.""  That's the most important thing to understand.  It's pre-danger behavior control."

c5denk*Meanwhile in England*We’re doing something right for once...
c5denk*Meanwhile in England*The UKs pretty good for vaping , and by that I mean theirs no war on vaping , in fact a group of MPs are advising the government to reduce restrictions surrounding vaping!
c5denk*Meanwhile in England*Right where they belong. Lol
c5denk*Meanwhile in England*"GB's public health system promotes vaping because healthier people save the govt money.

In the USA the govt makes more money off of unhealthy people."
c5denk*Meanwhile in England*I doubt we'd ever do that in America for concerns of theft. We're already making a big enough deal about teen vaping and that would just allow easy access to free vapes and juice. When I was a young teen they used to have packs of cigarettes at the end of the isle in grocery stores and I am guilty of snagging many packs. When you're a young stupid nicotine addict it's way too tempting with such easy access.
c5denk*Meanwhile in England*"This makes me happy to see some level of acceptance and understanding, and yet so sad at the same time knowing just how stupid and ignorant people/lawmakers are here in the states...Is putting anything in your lungs other than air safe? Probably not, but the vaping community has never claimed vaping to be harmless. They simply encourage it to be a tool to help people quit, which I've seen countless people do thanks to vaping or to give people a ""safer"" alternative. But the ebb and flow of it all boils down to money and who controls what market share....Big Tobacco has lost millions of customers, and fewer people are getting cancer, and the drug companies aren't liking that one bit. So they're trying to give vaping a bad rap. Which is sad, because they'd rather have more people smoking and getting cancer or other diseases caused by smoking, just to make a profit from the drugs and care they provide. Less sick people means fewer drugs being needed, means less profit for them. And it's why no matter how many times you read about promising cancer cures or treatments, that they will never become available to us. At least not any time soon. A cure demotes the continued necessity of pumping out more drugs and making more money..I'm willing to bet cancer could have been cured ages ago. But we won't ever have access or knowledge to those treatments. All in the name of profits and greed."
c5denk*Meanwhile in England*technically image only post and reported as spam, but I'll allow it since it's positive for vaping advocacy
c5denk*Meanwhile in England*"When I was a kid, my friends who smoked would come out of the grocery store with a sleeve full of cig packs. It was easy to get hooked on smokes. They were $1.48 for Marlboros.
I think rather than legislate behavior, which never works, the U.S. should just make access to nic harder. Don't eliminate this or that, but if you're old enough, you should be able to buy whatever.
I see toothpicks, losenges, etc. sitting at checkout by the gum and candy, yet vape juice is locked up as if it's a danger to the public. 
Another issue is that Juul pods have gigantic amounts of nic and give most vaping a bad name. I use .3mg and .6mg per ml ejuice, and yet some Juul devices have as much as 60mg. I know the devices are different, but nobody who doesn't vape know that, so it all gets demonized."

4yxwv9*Fed Judge finds Indiana Vape law unconstitutional*"Thanks! Just passed this to our lawyer to review the decision. If he gives us the thumbs up we're having a massive sale for anyone in Indiana to finally let you guys try Cloudride.

EDIT: Our lawyer has stated that this does not mean it's open season on Indiana for outside companies and only relates to the standing of GoodCat. Sorry guys :("
4yxwv9*Fed Judge finds Indiana Vape law unconstitutional*Next up PA?
4yxwv9*Fed Judge finds Indiana Vape law unconstitutional*"This law is rotten with the distinct smell of quid pro quo when apparently (1) it's written in a manner that requires security contracting in which only one company, which ""happens"" to be located in Indiana, that can (2) approve or deny any e-liquid company it sees fit, (3) has no accountability for any company it denies, (4) has refused GoodCat with no explanation, (5) refused to reply to inquiries from GoodCat in it's attempt to comply, (6) and the law is written so specifically with requirements seemingly unrelated to eliquid production quality/standards that it seems obviously intended to exclude all other security companies except the one.

This is like putting a contract out for bid for appearance of an impartial and fair bidding process, while tailoring the RFP so that only one desired company could possibly qualify, completely subverting the intent of a fair bidding process.

Someone needs to research the donations to the politicians who voted for this law or who administer it to see if this security company or its owners made contributions that have been disclosed."
4yxwv9*Fed Judge finds Indiana Vape law unconstitutional*"Here's to hoping I don't have to renew my Michigan PO box next July.

On behalf of the small percentage of sane Indiana residents I apologize for once again being a national embarrassment."
4yxwv9*Fed Judge finds Indiana Vape law unconstitutional*So they have to issue a permit to this Florida company?  Then what?  Sounds like good news but need someone to decode.
4yxwv9*Fed Judge finds Indiana Vape law unconstitutional*Page was kinda bugging out a little, so can I get more than like 9 brands of juice again?
4yxwv9*Fed Judge finds Indiana Vape law unconstitutional*It's not a complete win but I guess this means there is hope.  One judge at a time.
4yxwv9*Fed Judge finds Indiana Vape law unconstitutional*"The headline is, as far as I can tell after having read the ruling, misleading at best.

The judge didn't rule that the law was unconstitutional. He ruled that the plaintiff's case had enough chance of winning on that point, that issuing a preliminary injunction is justified. The framework a judge uses for that determination is a lower bar than an actual finding that the law is unconstitutional would require.

Any ruling that the law is actually unconstitutional would come later on in the case.

Don't get me wrong - the ruling is a win. It's just not a final 'yep, unconstitutional' ruling in the way the article's headline asserts."

dahkpf*In a lab test of 15 illegal weed vape carts, 13 contained a dangerous additive — and all 15 were contaminated with cyanide*It's an already illegal product causing the problem.  So I wanna know what banning flavored juice is going to do?  It's like banning all Subaru cars, Because Ford had a brake problem.
dahkpf*In a lab test of 15 illegal weed vape carts, 13 contained a dangerous additive — and all 15 were contaminated with cyanide*"Still not reporting a proper headline. 

It's a chemical that has the potential to convert to cyanide when burned. They found no cyanide in the liquids."
dahkpf*In a lab test of 15 illegal weed vape carts, 13 contained a dangerous additive — and all 15 were contaminated with cyanide*Yeah the cyanide thing has been known for the longest time. When the chemical Eagle 20 is heated to a certain point it breaks down and a byproduct is cyanide.
dahkpf*In a lab test of 15 illegal weed vape carts, 13 contained a dangerous additive — and all 15 were contaminated with cyanide*Well then. Lets do something stupid like banning pretty labels.

They get quiet after realizing I’ve done my research and they are actually clueless as to what’s going on. It’s unfortunate that the nicotine market is being affected by the black market of thc cartridges.
dahkpf*In a lab test of 15 illegal weed vape carts, 13 contained a dangerous additive — and all 15 were contaminated with cyanide*Been making my own THC carts for 2 years cause anyone with a brain that didnt get fried by these pens knew they were unsafe. Scary stuff

duf3rz*CDC Started a Vaping Panic, Now It’s Admitting Vitamin E Acetate In Illegal Products Is to Blame*Yeah, funny how you don’t hear anything about it now. Probably embarrassed at how fast they all were to jump on the bandwagon saying it was bad without enough information. Idiots.
duf3rz*CDC Started a Vaping Panic, Now It’s Admitting Vitamin E Acetate In Illegal Products Is to Blame*For some reason I’m super involved in the fake cartridge stuff and it was definitely the media that ruined it. 6 deaths from illegal cut thc oil vs almost half a million deaths from legal cigs annually is possibly the most blatant evidence of the real problem, one which vaping was made to counter. Thanks big tobacco boomers
duf3rz*CDC Started a Vaping Panic, Now It’s Admitting Vitamin E Acetate In Illegal Products Is to Blame*I'd argue it was the media that caused the panic
duf3rz*CDC Started a Vaping Panic, Now It’s Admitting Vitamin E Acetate In Illegal Products Is to Blame*"The ""drive by"" media started this. Report first, fact check later.  It's long past time these idiot's were held  accountable."
duf3rz*CDC Started a Vaping Panic, Now It’s Admitting Vitamin E Acetate In Illegal Products Is to Blame*"NO. Media organizations started a vaping panic based on almost no information at a time when the appropriate action would have been to wait and watch. The CDC did exactly what they are supposed to do. They already released statements. There was no reason for the media to write hundreds of pieces all based on the same void of facts, for weeks. If it were not for the media, the CDC statement would have been overlooked by the public. 

Take responsibility. When you adopt journalistic standards that equate to simply rewording government statements eighty different ways and pasting editorials in after, this is what happens.  Your crappy journalists caused this, not the CDC."
duf3rz*CDC Started a Vaping Panic, Now It’s Admitting Vitamin E Acetate In Illegal Products Is to Blame*"Every article still says ""some of"" or ""a percentage of"". No one is admitting the truth yet.

One of the greatest problems here is that people are too stupid to understand the most common sense detail in all of this. It's impossible that after 10 years of millions of people vaping without any problems suddenly there are dozens of people with serious problems and that it could be caused by vaping. It's obvious that there is another factor involved here that has nothing to do with normal vaping.

And we've all known what it was with very little research because someone figured it out a long time ago. The media, CDC, etc - still trying to figure shit out. They knew damn well what happened. They just weren't admitting it and still continue to say ""some of"" or ""we can't confirm all of yet""."
duf3rz*CDC Started a Vaping Panic, Now It’s Admitting Vitamin E Acetate In Illegal Products Is to Blame*"I just see it as a coordinated effort between government agencies and media. In the end, we are getting some federal legislation faster then what was supposed to happen. Control the ""panic"", force the legislation. Everyone can act blameless, and in public health's best interest. What we will be left with, is the big money players, and those few left making tobacco flavor vapes that will be able to afford the fees to get their juices approved. This was always about money."
duf3rz*CDC Started a Vaping Panic, Now It’s Admitting Vitamin E Acetate In Illegal Products Is to Blame*"The media doesn't get embarrassed. The Fukushima and Ebola stuff is still fresh in my mind and that doesn't even scratch the surface of the decades of ""Scare them so they watch"" garbage they have dumped on the world 

They made it seem like we were all going to die within months and then it just disappeared when the next potential ad revenue stream came up. Anyone that pays attention to mainstream ""news"" these days is the physical manifestation of stupidity."
duf3rz*CDC Started a Vaping Panic, Now It’s Admitting Vitamin E Acetate In Illegal Products Is to Blame*It doesn’t matter if they admit it now. Everyone I know already freaks out that I’m going to die when I pull out my vape no matter how many times I explain that the issue is vitamin E oil in illegal weed carts.

duf3rz*CDC Started a Vaping Panic, Now It’s Admitting Vitamin E Acetate In Illegal Products Is to Blame*Again, we knew this how long ago? Pathetic.
duf3rz*CDC Started a Vaping Panic, Now It’s Admitting Vitamin E Acetate In Illegal Products Is to Blame* Perhaps Americans should look at themselves,and try to understand what might be wrong about their national culture that has the largest population of  psychoactive drug consumers of both legal and illegal drugs.  The profit to be made in exploiting human weakness and the economic desparation of the majority of working people combined with an abandonment of parental responsibility have led this culture towards an abyss.  Let us hope that we are near a turning point and not already falling into chaos.

4p6t5n*11 Vaping Groups Unite To Sue FDA...*Can't explain how much it means when we read articles like this...
4p6t5n*11 Vaping Groups Unite To Sue FDA...*">""Under the TCA, however, smokeless tobacco products (e.g., chewing tobacco) are not subject to the modified risk requirements if a label or advertising uses phrases like “does not produce smoke,” “smokefree,” “smoke-free,” “without smoke,” “no smoke,” or “not smoke.” 21
>
>38. The TCA prohibits manufacturers and retailers from distributing free samples of tobacco products, but provides an exception for free samples of smokeless tobacco distributed in “qualified adult-only facilities.” 21 U.S.C. § 387a-1(a).""

That's messed up if true. Smokeless tobacco products were pushed because they were far safer than cigarettes, it seems like ecigs are being treated unfairly because of the fact they produce a vapor. 

Most of the rest of the points also are related to the assumption that congress created the TCA in order for the FDA to have the ability to lock down cigarettes, while promoting healthier alternatives. I suppose we'll see if the court agrees."

Please help vaping advocacy groups stand up against Big Tobacco.  Vaping is a less-harmful alternative to smoking, and provides a gentler transition to becoming nicotine-free.  It's also a relaxing hobby / activity and there are a multitude of small businesses nationwide which have started up to support this movement.  Current legislation is driving these businesses out and threatens to force vapers to start smoking cigarettes again.

""I would like to talk to you about the currently stagnant electronic cigarette industry. It has been proven time and time again that vaping is a safer alternative to smoking by about....Oh..95% give or take by independent studies across the world. I do not know how appropriate it is to actually put links in this letter, so i wont. However, a simple google search of ""vaping is safer than smoking"" will absolutely bombard whoever so desires to browse it with sourced and cited information regarding its safety and use as a smoking cessation device. In fact. I haven't smoked in 6 years because of it and, to be honest, haven't felt better in my adult life. Not to mention that it's quite enjoyable being a human fog machine from time to time, if I'm honest. I only ask that you suspend FDA regulations on the devices and liquids for the time being due to that fact that it has more to do with pharmaceutical companies losing out on making money with their nicotine patches and gums, and big tobaccos cigarette sales. One of these barely works if cited studies are to be believed, and cigarettes and cigars are just plain killing thousands of americans a year. Perhaps a revision of safety devices on the e-cigs in question would be a better idea as it is a fact that improper storage or placement in the pocket could cause battery detonation. A safety program would work best maybe? Like with a firearm, anything inherently dangerous in regards to its hardware needs to be able to be deactivated while being carried about, and analog vape devices, or ""mechanical"" mods, do indeed have a safety, but it is a rudimentary screw down ring around the baseplate that you press to activate the device. perhaps instead of focusing on the chemicals, which have already been individually approved by the Fda as it is, we could instead focus on the aspect of an automatically resetting safety that one would have to turn off in order to use. Once the initial use of the moment is done, said safety simply falls back into place by way of a gentle spring or gravity, something that would prevent unintended activation of the device without the actual need for the user to have to worry about screwing down a ring or penti-tapping the power button in a moment when quick use of the hands is necessary. Glocks patented ""safe action"" comes to mind, no accidents, no immediate intervention, just push the button and you get what you want, dont push the button, and nothing happens. I'm looking forward to hearing back on the matter either through legislation, or via email, whichever is most appropriate.    ps. i willingly voted for you. i have faith in what you can do. i genuinely hope and pray you will make this country great again."""

24k5x4*PLEASE UPVOTE FOR VISIBILITY! Statewide ban in NY to be voted on May 6th*"This bill would ban e-cigarette use everywhere in New York that smoking is banned.

Vapers should oppose this. Throughout New York there are likely hundreds if not thousands of bars, restaurants, private workplaces, etc. that allow or turn a blind eye to the respectful use of electronic cigarettes indoors.  When it is January and 10 degrees outside, and a business owner wants to allow it, why should the e-cigarette user have to go outside?

It's always amazing how complacent some vapers are with getting thrown under the bus alongside smokers.  Yes, in some social situations it may be inappropriate to vape, but that does NOT mean it is inappropriate in all indoor and some outdoor public places. 

Another thing to keep in mind: The Senator pushing this bill is also the lead sponsor on a bill to ban the sale of e-liquid to adults.  Do we really want to give him a win?"

To the general population, they dont give a crap what it is as to what it looks like. Vaping simply gives the same look as smoking an analog. So the population is going to want it to be regulated just like smoking, because all of a sudden, there is a loophole in the ""no smoking"" laws in public spaces. So of course people are going to complain, because it looks like youre smoking where you shouldnt. As for the bill itself, in all honesty theres a huge chance it will pass.

Also, on a semi-related note, everyone should do themselves a favor and get a cheap harbor freight drill press. With some creativity (and a little disregard for safety) you can use it as a makeshift lathe or mill for small stuff. You'll wonder how you managed to do anything without it.

4i0804*To all my friends and coworkers delighting in sending me articles about the FDA regulations...*"Well said.

I NEVER thought I could stop smoking. Smoked 2 PAD for 30 years and tried everything to stop. Took up vaping and haven't had a cigarette in over a year and a half and don't miss them at all.

This IS deadly serious. I'm not a hobbyist, I'm someone who wanted my health back and I got it. If anyone out there is gloating about this they can just fuck off."
4i0804*To all my friends and coworkers delighting in sending me articles about the FDA regulations...*"Hey, non-vaper from /r/all here. While I don't know enough about the product or new regulations to weigh in on their reasonableness(or lack thereof), it sounds like the FDA is completely ignoring the use of ecigs as an alternative to smoking. 

The FDA should have at least crafted an exception where physicians can prescribe ecigs to patients looking to quit smoking. And while I am not sure what health issues are associated with ecigs, I imagine they must pale in comparison to the *known* and *well documented* damage tar-ridden tobacco cigarettes causes to the body. "
4i0804*To all my friends and coworkers delighting in sending me articles about the FDA regulations...*People feel some sort of moral superiority over people when it comes to both smoking and vaping. Like they don't have any vices.

The fact that somehow the higher up's can classify E-Juice as a tobacco product and lump it into the same category and treat it as such is something that helps me lose sleep at night.

5hsrvi*Vapor Chef, WTF?*It's a Jeep thing guys, we wouldn't understand.
5hsrvi*Vapor Chef, WTF?*This is a sad state of affairs no matter how you look at it. A lot of us vendors have tied ourselves to our personal profiles and information that, in a way, we're public figures to our customers. When you start acting like this, threads like these pop up. There's no excuse for TVC's behavior here or some other times in the past. I unfriended him 1-2 weeks ago because another thread just like this popped up in my feed and got sick of seeing things like that. This just isn't how responsible adults should act. 
5hsrvi*Vapor Chef, WTF?*"Just read his comments over the months on here or his FB, which is public, the guy clearly has problems. 

He can do NO WRONG. Anything he disagrees with is 100% wrong because he created a small business and this makes him the smartest guy in the world. 

Reading through his FB, he regularly mentions how he made ""XXX millions last year"" and ""paid for my cars and house in cash"". Who the fuck talks like that?

I've met this kind of person many times. They are holier-than-thou because of one success they've had. Anyone who disagrees is a chump and loser.

News flash buddy, anyone who started a company in this industry simply got in at the right time. You'd have to be seriously retarded to have opened a vape company 2 years ago and NOT make a ton of cash. 

The guy was a line cook who made eliquid, but talks like he's the goddamn 2nd coming of christ because of it. His meltdowns prior to this were bad, but this is the motherload. 

How on earth nobody cared about it until now is beyond me. He's a bully and now it's proven."

1zjntg*This was in yesterday's paper. Such a load of bullshit.*"As a public health educator and former smoker/vaper, this disgusts me.  Aside from the argument that it entices our youth to vape, the application of e-cigs to tertiary prevention of smokers (making current smokers prevent further damage) is so useful especially in today's society where the actual number one cause of death since 2008 has been smoking.  Cancer, heart disease, COPD; they all correlate back to smoking and this is just some shit-bag cartoonist for a local fucking paper with nothing better to do than take jabs at something so (potentially) extremely powerful of taking off and literally changing the world as we know it.  


I have literally converted my entire fire department (the one's who do smoke) into vapers.  We can now sit inside, watch Duck Dynasty, and enjoying nicotine in a much safer, more responsible way.  


People need to sit down, read and inform themselves on the benefits, and wait for the POSSIBLE however highly unlikely health cons of vaping, and not get caught up in this media-health-concern-fluff-bullshit.  90% of the shit you see pertaining to ""wacky health problem that made you fat"" on Dr. Oz is on a behavioral level.  You smoke, you don't eat right, and you're sedentary.  


And here are people taking a stand against their motherfucking smoking lifestyle, making an active change to better themselves and the people around them, and we get fucking scrutinized for ""destroying our youth.""  Like the popular argument, show the kids some Pinnacle Whipped Cream, no one bats an eye.  Show them a vape with Cherry Limeade flavor and everyone loses their mind.

1zjntg*This was in yesterday's paper. Such a load of bullshit.*"I'm new to e-cigs, but I've done political advocacy on another hot-button issue.  I can tell you that authors and editors rely on quick ""gotchas"" far more than they do research.  Research is *hard* and *boring*, and they've got a *deadline* to meet.  It's way easier to spread FUD than it is to have a reasoned discussion.

This is also how bad legislation gets passed.  Politicians are even worse at research.  They'll form a conclusion, then send the interns to get research that backs that conclusion.  Right now, it's trending towards ""ban these things before *OMGthinkofthechildren.*""  It's *easy* to do that, and Mr. Politician looks like he's doing something to solve a problem, even if it's an imaginary problem he created.

It falls to us to educate them.  We've got to hit the op-ed columns and call our representatives.  More to the point, we've got to reach out to the general public.  The battle is over perception.

I'm really impressed at the amount of that already being done.  After all, this issue is only a few years old, but some folks have done some really spectacular work.  The best argument we can make is that these things are a phenomenal tool for smoking cessation.  

The health and financial costs of tobacco can't be overstated.  **That** is the *problem.*  E-cigs are a *solution* that can and will save lives, hospital beds, and money.  That's the best course to take in our arguments."

I'm fine if they make the legal age for nicotine juice to be 18, but what harm is there in kids smoking the nicotine free ones? Kids who want to smoke are going to smoke anyhow, so I'd much rather them be smoking e-cigs instead of real cigarettes, especially if it's the ones with 0 nicotine, as they won't get addicted. But even if they do smoke the nicotine juice by getting someone else to buy it for them, big deal, it will be much better for their health then cigarettes.

9g0ufh*NY Daily News Op Ed - The stupid war on vaping: If underage consumption does not justify a ban on tobacco cigarettes, it cannot possibly justify a ban on competing products that are much safer.*Reminds me ALOT of pirating media back in the day. Instead of record and movie labels investing in the future and making the tech needed to keep them profitable in the digital age... they pissed away million$ fighting Napster and the like. It's the never ending tale of old money keeping the status quo instead of learning how to make new money
9g0ufh*NY Daily News Op Ed - The stupid war on vaping: If underage consumption does not justify a ban on tobacco cigarettes, it cannot possibly justify a ban on competing products that are much safer.*Welcome to the world of lobbyist run government. This has been ongoing problem for as long as I can remember. 
9g0ufh*NY Daily News Op Ed - The stupid war on vaping: If underage consumption does not justify a ban on tobacco cigarettes, it cannot possibly justify a ban on competing products that are much safer.*Better yet... Alcohol kills more people per year than any other drug. They shamelessly make youth appealing flavors such as watermelon, birthday cake, apple pucker, cherry pucker, vanilla, chocolate,pineapple etc.  Nobody is up in arms about that. Additionally the cbc numbers show that while more middle and highschoolers have tried ecigs than actual cigarettes, those numbers have been on the decline since 2015.
9g0ufh*NY Daily News Op Ed - The stupid war on vaping: If underage consumption does not justify a ban on tobacco cigarettes, it cannot possibly justify a ban on competing products that are much safer.*yep, but the vaping industry does not have powerfull  lobbyists and a war chest to pay the media.
9g0ufh*NY Daily News Op Ed - The stupid war on vaping: If underage consumption does not justify a ban on tobacco cigarettes, it cannot possibly justify a ban on competing products that are much safer.*Ironic that no one does a flipping thing about tobacco. A product that kills you and the people around you.

Arguably one of the most ridiculous things imaginable. On the one hand, we're realizing our mistakes regarding marijuana and correcting them, but then on the other, we're attacking vaping and Kratom.

9g0ufh*NY Daily News Op Ed - The stupid war on vaping: If underage consumption does not justify a ban on tobacco cigarettes, it cannot possibly justify a ban on competing products that are much safer.*"Thank you   Jacob Sullum you got it.

If you have been following vaping for any length of time you know this all comes down to money/taxes.

When they ether control vaping or tax it enough they will be happy. 

 History repeats it's self,Booze was illegal government control legal.Pot illegal with government control legal. see a pattern? Big pharma will run the show and there will be a black market.

I do not want to see any of this happen.Let the vape industry run it's self with common sense regulation. we a bunch of medium companies and a lot of small shops that can't agree on any thing VS  multi trillion conglomerates with more lobbyist and layers then all the people in the vape industry. 

 And act of congress and the signature of our president (who ever it is) is all that will save vaping.

I will keep fighting because doing nothing will seal or fate for sure. learn DIY juice making and stick together.

We thought it was hilarious as a student from a small, rural and well behaved school to say we did a ton of coke and had high risk sex with multiple partners. I’m pretty sure if “do you vape?” was on that list, we would have laughed and checked yes. 
9g0ufh*NY Daily News Op Ed - The stupid war on vaping: If underage consumption does not justify a ban on tobacco cigarettes, it cannot possibly justify a ban on competing products that are much safer.*"The only problem with this argument is that flavored cigarettes are banned... 

Edit: my point is that regular cigarettes are already heavily regulated, including the flavors and nicotine conent.  We don't want that for ecigs, so this is a stupid comparison to make.  "
9g0ufh*NY Daily News Op Ed - The stupid war on vaping: If underage consumption does not justify a ban on tobacco cigarettes, it cannot possibly justify a ban on competing products that are much safer.*I think it would be more beneficial to raise the purchase age to 21. It was a lot harder to find alcohol than cigarettes in high school because you're not really friends with people that old.
9g0ufh*NY Daily News Op Ed - The stupid war on vaping: If underage consumption does not justify a ban on tobacco cigarettes, it cannot possibly justify a ban on competing products that are much safer.*Using kids to forward obvious agendas by your govt. & big tobacco to stomp out vaping, is disgusting and despicable!  The govt. needs big tobacco’s money to survive.  No smokers = no govt. $. Wake up, don’t fall for yet another lie.  Vaping saves lives, and if vaping is banned, by all rights cigarettes have to go as well!

d2t8ff*Trump administration readies ban on flavored e-cigarettes*IF THEY BAN MENTHOL VAPES BEFORE MENTHOL CIGS I SWEAR TO GOD FUCK THIS EARTH
d2t8ff*Trump administration readies ban on flavored e-cigarettes*"The logic:

A) THC carts (specifically with Vitamin E acetone) are causing the lung illnesses. 

B) THC carts are not nicotine products. Vitamin E acetone is not used in any over the counter nicotine products. 

Thus: 

C) vaping nicotine products is causing the lung illnesses 

It’s a fucking joke"
d2t8ff*Trump administration readies ban on flavored e-cigarettes*"Well shit. Guess I'm losing my vape shop job and guess that my 100+ customers that all have switched from analogs to e-cigs because they crave their nicotine but hate the taste of tobacco are all fucked too.

Why the FUCK are they banning ecig flavors, but don't give a fuck about alcohol flavors?? Almost all my friends started drinking underage because of how good fireball tasted for them. Not to mention, 3 of my friends got their stomachs pumped because they kept drinking their drinks because they tasted so good and didn't notice how much they were consuming. All underage too. But that's not actually killing people right? 1?1!1!1 /s

Complete asshats in FDA. Actually puts a sour taste in my mouth."
d2t8ff*Trump administration readies ban on flavored e-cigarettes*Let’s keep tobacco which kills 500k-ish people per year legal but ban ecigs which aren’t necessarily connected!

d2t8ff*Trump administration readies ban on flavored e-cigarettes*Here's an idea: Rather then banning flavored e-cigs all together why not do some actual research about what is going into the products? Maybe take a deeper look into the black market for illegal THC carts that seem to be causing all this trouble in the first place?

7fw0jp*My 2-year-old son keeps asking for some of this “juice”. (And they say OUR labels are a danger to children!!)*Wow that's so stupid with all the fruit on the label of course a child will think it's juice I almost would without reading it close

If e-juice is made of Propylene glycol,  Vegetable glycerin, and flavoring, then isn't the vapor anything besides water vapor (as commonly toted)? I know that both PG and VG are used in food and medicine, but isn't the effects of vaping both chemicals unknown to some extent? That's before you add in the nicotine. I'm sorry, but I have a hard time convincing myself nicotine is risk free when being inhaled.

That being said, I'm positive vaping is a million times safer than smoking a cigarette, but does it have to be touted as either the 'Next thing to kill our population' or 'Cure to all diseases'?

Even if this was in the public portion of reddit someone calling you a chimp, which didnt happen in this instance, should not be a ban offense. Can i request someone be banned if they call me a chimp? How about if someone calls me a fucking asshole commie lover? I ask because i have certainly seen people use such language towards others, perhaps not all at once, and not be banned.

For some of us who have quit cigarettes, vaping in bed and/or while relaxing is a chore. For those who don't have a tank like the Uwell D1, leaking is a bitch and we want to lay down without turning our tank upside down. I was hoping for the best of both worlds when I searched for an extendable drip tip for my tank. This idea here was I'd have it go off of the drip tip as promised, helping me inhale vape at a weird angle. I searched through Reddit and the internet for about an hour and this was the best, most cost-effective mod/drip tip I could find (in stock). Once the ""drip tip"" itself arrived, I realized that this wasn't a drip tip at all, and after $13 at MadVapes (the first one broke IMMEDIATELY while trying to angle it) this insane contraption had forced its way into my life.

d6vrnd*Conspiracy*source?
d6vrnd*Conspiracy*NY has a very high tax on cigarettes. A pack of cigarettes in NY costs over $10 due to the excessive taxes. When people decide to quit smoking and children decide to vape instead of smoke, it cuts into their tax revenue. NY actually wants people to smoke cigarettes despite that the purpose of the high tax was to get people to quit.
d6vrnd*Conspiracy*Everything is about money.  I thought this was obvious.
d6vrnd*Conspiracy*I wonder what illicit drug they was using to come up with this
d6vrnd*Conspiracy*"As soon as they started putting high taxes on tobacco and stating that the money was going to be used for schools (in some cases). My first question was: So what happens when people quit and the tax revenue that the states will now rely on starts drying up? The answer: Tax E-Cigs the same as tobacco! But they have to have the same arguments that we had against tobacco. And what do you know. Deaths, people in the hospital, and it's harming our children. 

I think a big problem that they will have is trying to tax the individual components if people start mixing their own liquids."
d6vrnd*Conspiracy*"Okay, I have to say I am getting tired of this conspiracy bullshit, especially in regards to the MSA.   Let me explain this in no uncertain terms regarding MSA bonds.   The states don't care.  They have no obligation.  Cigarettes could vanish overnight, and it would make no difference to the states in regards to the MSA.

When the MSA was signed, it guaranteed regular payments from the Tobacco companies to the states, the percentage based on a companies share of the market.  

The vast majority of states ran to Wall Street, and cashed in.  They issued bonds, guaranteed by those payments, and took their money.  Some spent it on healthcare, most didn't, using the monies to fill budget gaps, etc.  

The bonds are not obligations of the state.  The only role that the states have is in collecting what monies they get from the MSA payments, giving them to the trustee of the bonds, to pay the bondholders.   
The people who bought these bonds knew before, during, and after they decided to buy them, that the source of payment was the MSA payments.  That if the tobacco companies sold no cigarettes, there would be no payments, and the bonds would default.   The state was not required to pay them or make them whole.  

I have been a professional investor in bonds since before the first tobacco deal came to market.   It was always clear that smoking rates were falling, would continue to fall, that states were actively trying to kill smoking, and therefore there was the risk of default.   If that happened, it is the INVESTORS - Bond Funds, individual investors, etc that suffer.  The states?  Are fine.   Business as usual.  The already got all they were going to get from the settlement, years and years ago, and spent it.   

Now the other side of this issue is tax revenue.   Before we talk about taxes, lets talk about all the other things states have done about cigarette smoking.   Raised the age.  Made ID checks mandatory.  Banned vending machines.  Banned advertising.  Banned mini-packs.  Banned promotional giveaways.  Banned smoking in offices, public transport, public buildings, parks, beaches, in cars with minor children, even in your OWN HOME if you live in public housing in some places.   They have set up quit hotlines and programs, given away thousands of patches, lozenges, pamphlets and promoted education and awareness of the dangers of smoking.   All of this has one actual, direct, and well publicized goal: to stop people smoking.   This is not lip service.  Even without the addition of punitive taxation, all the above mentioned efforts have been effective in reducing cigarette use.  Look at Virginia, who has not used punitive taxation, yet their smoking rates have dropped to below the national average, thanks to programs like this.   

So let's get to the cynical side - taxes.  Taxes on cigarettes are ostensibly designed to dissuade people to smoke, but at the same time provide revenue that governments want and need.  Smoking has been declining (and the tax revenue with it) for decades.   And here comes vaping, accelerating that decline as people cross over from cigarettes, and others start vaping instead of starting cigarettes.     

Why the fuck do people think that politicians are opting to milk a dying cow, instead of taxing a new golden goose?   There is no rational reason from a revenue standpoint that politicians would ban vaping.  It is a new, growing revenue stream, replacing one that has been dying for decades.  Its not hard to put taxes on it.  Taxing it is easier than banning it, and has the added bonus of more money for politicians.   

And before people start saying ""Tobacco Lobby"" - who the hell do you think owns big stakes and is investing in vaping?  Big tobacco is not stupid.  They have known for years tobacco is dying domestically, and have been doing everything they can to get into vaping.   You think they want to see it banned? 

**TL;DR: There is no fucking conspiracy, and people need to learn how bonds and taxation works.**"

d6vrnd*Conspiracy*"""THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!!"" = BS

They ARE worried about the CHILDREN ALRIGHT... worried that there won't be another generation to milk for their #msabloodmoney to help fund their next political campaign, pay off their multi-million dollar ""vacation home/political campaign central headquarters"" or repay the BONDS THEY PERSONALLY PURCHASED.

The only time that they should be thinking of the children, pertaining to the current subject, is HOW ARE THOSE CHILDREN GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF ONCE THE VAPING INDUSTRY IS OBLITERATED IN THIS COUNTRY AND THEIR FAMILY DIES FROM ONE OF HUNDREDS OF SMOKING-RELATED ILLNESSES???

And if you think that reducing the amount of nicotine delivered from each cigarette smoked is about ""weaning"" smokers off of combustible tobacco products...then I've got beachfront property for sale in Arizona! If smokers are truly nicotine addicted, lower nicotine cigarettes won't make them smoke less, IT WILL HAVE THE EXACT OPPOSITE EFFECT... THEY'LL SMOKE MORE!!! 

EXAMPLE:

     John drinks a pot of coffee per day, to feed his      
     caffeine addiction. His body is used to that      
     level of caffeine in his system in order to          
     ""function properly"". But, Starbucks decides to 
     limit the amount of caffeine in order to wean 
     people off of caffeine.
     
      Instead of causing John and others like him to 
     to drink less coffee, caffeine-addicted 
     consumers have to drink MORE to maintain a  
      level of caffeine that their bodies crave. Now
     instead of one pot of coffee, John's now
     drinking 2-3 pots per day, which means he's
     buying 2-3 times as much coffee, which
     increases Starbucks' overall profits."

I wanted to quit smoking and I won a mod from one of the giveaway which was unexpected. Not long after that, I won some juices too. My dad always hated me smoking and when I got those giveaways, it almost feels like he gave it to me through the giveaways.

Yours in the other hand, gave it to you directly and it is such a beautiful gestures I had to read your story twice. I don't know what else to say but just to stay strong, your mood might get shitty again but always remember to make him proud even when he's not in this world anymore.

49mv5o*An emotional vape story*That was beautiful man. I almost ended up in a similar situation. Best wishes to you moving forward
49mv5o*An emotional vape story*"Maybe I'm a sociopath, but this story didn't make me as sad as much as it pissed me off. It pissed me off that someone could do that to your Dad. I obviously don't know him or the life he lived, but it sounds like he was a class-act guy and that he loved you very much. The fact someone could take someone like that from our world enrages me.

Now all of a sudden I'm super sad.

This isn't a story for here really, but Parents + Vaping is something close to the heart, and your story tears me up inside.
My Dad actually turned both my Mom and I on to vaping, before even Blu E-Cigs existed. I remember using my Dad's (this was back when they were like Blu's but with cartridges that were even more complex) and thinking it was insane and revolutionary, and that year my Mom got both her and I an original Blu each for christmas. We all vaped off and on, and eventually all three of us upgraded to Pen vapes (actually, we all had Volcano Infernos), but gradually both of my parents quit vaping and went back to smoking. Now I've got a KBOX 200, and I'm trying to get my parents back into vaping, but it's a challenge. A modern device could do them wonders if they'd give them a chance, but they feel like they've ""been there/done that"" now, and are just happy it's worked for me. 

Idk. I'm rambling. I'm sorry OP. I guess your story has got me all emotional and thinking about my own parents and how I worry about them.

Keep on vaping OP. I'd say your father would be proud of you. It might not matter since you don't even know me, but I'm proud of you.
"
49mv5o*An emotional vape story*"I can read between the lines OP, hey stick around as long as you can. Have kids, and do your Dad proud. You had a good one. And for all those fuckers that took him out before his time, they aren't even human. How you carry your life on, is though. Do it for him.

3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*While this is obvious to us, it's not to other people and it's important that it gets attention. 
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*I quit 2 months ago after smoking for 30 years. I puff on an ecig when I have a nic fit. I'm at 12 mil of nicotine right now. I feel great and my lungs cleared up surprisingly fast. I don't even have a smoker's cough anymore 
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*We just need to keep seeing studies like this; it feels like we're going up against anti-vax logic sometimes.
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*about time...
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*Duh, that's the whole point of them, why do people think they Feds are putting crazy regulations down and suddenly there's tons of anti vaping ads? Tobacco companies are paying for it all, they've done a terrific job of demonizing its public image and now they've struck the coffin nails home by bribing the FDA.
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*Wait wasn't the CDC all about banning these? Now they say they work. What the hell is going on? Am I taking crazy pills?
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*#WELL HOW ABOUT THAT SHIT?
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*"Quit smoking 3 years ago thanks to vaping. I smoked for 12 years prior.  I tried the gum, the patch, the spray, the laser, even hypnotism. 

I started vaping and after 8 months I was down to 0mg nicotine juice from 32mg. 

Then I just stopped. No cravings. No withdrawal. I just didn't need to smoke anymore

I owe that to vaping. It literally saved my life. "
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*They CDC was like hay, the FDA is getting all this dough, like I want some....  Let me rain on their parade, because I can.  Maybe I can figure a way to get some.  Government is like little kids in the back of a mini-van.
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*Well duuuhhhhh. Seriously, though, nice to see some public facing data to support what we already know. 
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*Too bad nothing about the lingering FDA regulations will notice it or recognize that they were wrong.
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*I wish they would cancel the commercial about the dangers of vaping, then.
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*I don't need CDC data to tell me that shit.  My dad quit smoking after 52 years.  He did that by vaping, going through nicotine withdrawals, and decreasing levels down to zero.  Pretty damn simple.
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*"Yet another ""No shit"", but unfortunately people have to be told the obvious a million times before it sinks in."
3r8c8o*New CDC Data Suggest E-Cigarettes Are Helping Smokers Quit*Today is my 6 month anniversary of not having a cigarette. I am down to 1.5mg buying 3 and 0 and mixing. I smoked for 20 stupid years. I can't even imagine. Man, I was stupid. The other day I smelled the rain again. I'm not sure if any of you know that smell but I love it. And forgot about it from my poor sense of smell from smoking. It was such a wonderful moment for me bringing me back to my childhood. Best and only way I have ever been able to quit, and I've tried everything.

7zpokn*smear tactic against vape industry alert!!!*"Via Konstantinos Farsalinos 

For those asking questions about the latest study on metal emissions from e-cigarettes, here is my comment:
The ""significant amount"" of metals the authors reported they found were measured in ug/kg. In fact they are so low that for some cases (chromium and lead) I calculated that you need to vape more than 100 ml per day in order to exceed the FDA limits for daily intake from inhalational medications. The authors once again confuse themselves and everyone else by using environmental safety limits related to exposure with every single breath, and apply them to vaping. However, humans take more than 17,000 (thousand) breaths per day but only 400-600 puffs per day from an e-cigarette.

*upvote for visibility*"
7zpokn*smear tactic against vape industry alert!!!*Took a while to read but the Russian doll of tobacco/health institutes was especially interesting. Thanks for taking the time.
7zpokn*smear tactic against vape industry alert!!!*"Thanks for the good work here man; really great job especially on the part where you explain they were probably dry hitting the coil at low flow.  I only have one comment:

The study actually does eventually mention the mass per volume of lead instead of the mass per mass.  It’s buried on page 7.  Sounds like 48% of the aerosol samples did exceed EPA limit (rolling 3 month average).

From the study:

> Pb concentrations ranged from 1.49 × 10^−6 to 2.75 × 10^−2 (median 1.06 × 10^ −4) mg/m3, with 48% of aerosol samples exceeding the U.S. EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) (U.S. EPA 2016) of 1.50 × 10^−4 mg/m3

7zpokn*smear tactic against vape industry alert!!!*"Genuine question here, please don't downvote me to oblivion (And I myself have been using e-cigs for a while)

When substances are deemed food-safe (ex: the amount of lead in vegetables) can they also be considered safe when vaping?

Inhalation and ingestion being different, I'm wondering if there is any effect on the lungs that there wouldn't be if ingested otherwise? 

Or is it more of a case-by case situation rather than the general 'food-safe'?"
7zpokn*smear tactic against vape industry alert!!!*I love to vape and how I quit chewing and think there is some bad stuff in chewing tobacco
7zpokn*smear tactic against vape industry alert!!!*PELs should definitely be a major factor in these studies. Especially when they brought up popcorn lung back in 2016. If you compare the exposure limits from vaping to industry standards placed by companies such as OSHA you will find they are well below the PEL allowed and deemed safe. I learned this in my intro to OSH class when we talked about the major diacetly incident that took place in a popcorn factory. For any independent study it all PELs are readily available online as required by law and if vapes we're to exceed that I'm sure they would have been cut from the market by now.

4wqwou*We had to make some changes to some of our posters in the shop for today.*"So, you can go into a store and buy cigarettes that WILL kill you, and that's fine by the FDA because ""you know the risks"".

But you go into a vape shop and buy a setup that MIGHT (MIGHT!) cause health problems in 40 years, and we're not allowed to because there isn't any evidence that it will kill us? So unless it's 100% proven to cause cancer, we aren't allowed to make up our own damn minds as adults? What fucking planet am I living on?"

The swisher sweets are underneath that sign, as well as lighters and various other blunt wraps. If I had to guess, they have been expanding their selection and trying to make the ecigs more prominent.

As you can see, the actual approved smoking cessation stuff is just to the right, so I think they just haven't fixed their signs at the top (of which there are likely others like ""batteries"" or razors/shaving equipment etc).

I mean, it's good propaganda to make vapers who are in the know incensed, but I don't think there is any more to it than that.

For instance, what does the sign to the left of smoking cessation say on the top left? We can't see it, so we can't see if there has been bleed from one category into another (cigarettes/vaping gear) etc.

2tzd8k*Anti-Vaping Researchers Called Out for Misleading Cancer Exaggerations by New York Times Columnist*"Even the NYTimes article doesn't get it.

Saying that we don't vape at higher voltages is a pointless statement: it's neither true nor false because without more information the number is arbitrary.

If they want to dumb it down for the dumb people that unfortunately represent the vast majority of the population, including many eCig/vape users, they need to say ""High-temperature"" or something.

THAT is the problem with the study and the almost obsessive attention that it's getting."
2tzd8k*Anti-Vaping Researchers Called Out for Misleading Cancer Exaggerations by New York Times Columnist*"I really wish it was more clear at what point we are pushing it too far, and producing formaldehyde! 

I seem to recall the study saying 5volts was producing formaldehyde while 3volts wasn't. I was alarmed since I often run at that level! But when I tried 3volts, I was getting next to no vapour production. 

So then I read that it actually depends on how many ohms your atomizer is at too. I found a chart online that indicated that with my 1.8ohm head, that indeed I shouldn't be going over about 3.9 volts! 

Later, I then read, that I'm using a dual-coil atomizer, so that in fact that chart is not necessarily accurate unless I multiple the ohms by two, giving me 3.6 ohms. 

I'm using a Provari with an Aspire Nautilus Tank, and 1.8ohm atomizers. (dual coil as far as I understand) I just want to know what voltages are considered safe!?"

2w5ggo*Ohio bill to add $34 tax to 30mL bottle of eliquid*As a person who lives in Ohio... ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.

> .2. Match the tax on non-cigarette forms of tobacco to the cigarette tax to reduce the number of people using these products and *prevent cigarette smokers from switching* instead of quitting;

Fuck you American Lung Association ... Fuck you.

2w5ggo*Ohio bill to add $34 tax to 30mL bottle of eliquid*"Completely ignoring how nicotine is metabolized in vaping, and only pretty much considering cigalikes..oh did I mention NICOTINE LEVELS IN JUICE? lol
By their science I my vaping habit is equivalent to a 10 pack a day smoker."
2w5ggo*Ohio bill to add $34 tax to 30mL bottle of eliquid*Wow. Their logic is supremely fucked.
2w5ggo*Ohio bill to add $34 tax to 30mL bottle of eliquid*"Definition of a ""vapor product"" per the bill:
>""Vapor product"" means a noncombustible product that
contains or is made or derived from nicotine, that is intended and
marketed for human consumption, including by smoking, inhaling,
snorting, or sniffing, and that includes any component, part, or
additive that is intended for use in a mechanical heating element,
battery, or electronic circuit and is used to deliver the product.
""Vapor product"" does not include any product that is a drug,
device, or combination product, as those terms are defined or
described in 21 U.S.C. 321 or 353(g). ""Vapor product"" includes any
product containing nicotine, regardless of concentration.

So, nic-free e-liquid are not included in this tax. Theoretically, you can avoid the majority of the tax by selling 0 nic for the bulk and get taxed on a ""booster shot"" of 100 mg/ml which you are supposed to add at home. Which would be perfectly safe for ordinary folks. /s

So, 30 mg 0 nic + 2 ml 100 mg/ml (end up with 32 ml @ 6.25 mg/ml) gets taxed $2.25 as opposed to $33.75. You can probably do better with pure nicotine (1000 mg/ml), but that would just be silly, right?

A safer alternative is using doublers or triplers like the Aussies do. Still have to mix at home, but with a more reasonable concentration (e.g. 24 mg/ml, 36 mg/ml).

All in all, the wording in the inserted portion of the bill sounds like it was written by one of the major anti-vaping groups (ALA, etc). It also includes a lot of specific licensing for ""vapor dealers"". Contact your Ohio House member and express your dismay at this outrageous cash grab...a cash grab which may end up costing Ohioans their lives by continuing to feed their nicotine dependence via cigarettes, as it would be undeniably the cheaper option."

Seriously though, Ohio is a conservative state when you look at state politics. Lean on your state rep, lean on your state senator. Play the tea party angle if you have to. They might actually listen because being ""that guy that raised taxes and destroyed jobs"" is not a label you want to have when it's election time."

2w5ggo*Ohio bill to add $34 tax to 30mL bottle of eliquid*I am an Ohioan. Fuck. 
2w5ggo*Ohio bill to add $34 tax to 30mL bottle of eliquid*"So if you purchase 30ml with 0mg of nic you wouldn't have to pay tax right? How could they justify it by saying it's ""equals 300"" cigarettes when they don't have nicotine less cigarettes? 

Also couldn't you just buy a big bottle of nic and mix it in yourself after the fact?"
2w5ggo*Ohio bill to add $34 tax to 30mL bottle of eliquid*"As a manager of a tobacconist in Ohio, I'd like to say there is a pretty big group fighting this budget right now.

The OPCPA, of which pretty much every major tobacconist in Ohio has joined up with, put on a number of fundraisers last year to hire a lobbyist against these proposed taxes, and they are in the middle of meetings with the governor's office and fighting this as we speak.

While it was formed at first to address taxes on cigars and pipe tobaccos (this budget calling for a raise from the current 17% to a 60% tax), the goal now is to fight all smoking-related taxes, including this eCig one.

As of right now, I've been informed that the best thing we can do at the moment is contact our representatives and Kasich himself about how these taxes will kill businesses in Ohio.

It doesn't take long to write and send a letter, so I'd encourage everyone to do so, as every little bit helps."

Vaping is relatively new, and there is a lot of misinformation floating around. Media in particular has been known to misinterpret and blow out of proportion some of the research that has been done, while leaving out other crucial facts. This is an attempt to clear up some of the common misconceptions.

I hope that you will share these around to people that need to know more about vaping, and how big of an impact it could have on world health.

Activism does work, band together and fight this, If we can get rid of a sin tax in Utah, of all places, Washington should be a walk in the park, just remember to be respectful, and use short, easy to understand, sentences when talking with government representatives.

203u66*I work for a vape shop in Vancouver, WA. We will go OUT OF BUSINESS if these pass. Please help washington get its head out of its a$$*A fucking extortion racket.  Yet libertarians are some how the nutty ones and people will defend these powers to the hilt while ignoring the obvious misuses.  There is no damn justifiable reason to additionally tax e-cigs except to take money from people without the power to fight it.  Smoking has been demonized to such an extent that the majority won't care.

203u66*I work for a vape shop in Vancouver, WA. We will go OUT OF BUSINESS if these pass. Please help washington get its head out of its a$$*"Here's a link to the house bill, which has some updates that the senate bill does not have-  http://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2795.pdf 

It doesn't clarify actual percentages of taxes, but instead refers to taxes being imposed according to RCW 82.26.020, whatever that is. Clarification would be welcomed. 

Do we know the probability of this passing? How much support it has in the state legislature of Washington?

If what OP states is true though, they aren't intending to tax anything. They are trying to shut down small businesses that take business from tobacco companies, and the sad thing is, it's not a fair fight. It's easier for tobacco companies to have an effect on these small time legislatures compared to FDA regulations, and this is where it's going to hit us. This is why the vaping community needs a state-to-state and overall national union in my opinion, it's the only way we could actually get any leverage in legislature. Honestly, we need lobbyists, the only way we could afford that is a union. I would gladly donate to such an organization. It's the only way to protect the interests of juice manufacturers like myself and retailers like this one in Washington, and to maintain the integrity of the industry as a whole. "
203u66*I work for a vape shop in Vancouver, WA. We will go OUT OF BUSINESS if these pass. Please help washington get its head out of its a$$*"You really have to appreciate the delicious irony of what's going on here.  The US Government (WITH YOUR SUPPORT). started taxing the holy living hell out of tobacco about 25 years ago. They did this under the battle cry that raising taxes would cause people to quit smoking and every will live for ever and ever in the land of milk and honey, with no medical problems ever.  

The problem starts here because a vast majority of our citizens, (even smokers) had been convinced that smoking was the root of all health problems in this country.  So we let our non smoking neighbors impose taxes to the tune of up to 500% or more in some cases.  No one bitched because it was not politically correct to argue FOR tobacco users.  Everyone ate that shit sammich and started passing state laws to tax tobacco users to death.  

 E cigarettes came about not because of technology, but because there was a terrific demand for them. Nicotine itself will not kill you.  It is a mild stimulant and sedative and addictive as all hell. Nothing more really. We just needed a cheaper way to get it without Uncle Sam cleaning out our wallet in the process.  So their argument that they need to tax ecigs for medical reasons suddenly becomes mute.  This is where you really have them by the balls.  There is no justification at all for such a ridiculous tax. You need to challenge them to give you one.   

Governments got pretty fat on our unjust taxes over the last 25 years, and now they are starting to see those revenues drop because of the exodus to e-cigs.  What they are doing is EXACTLY the kind of crap that caused the Civil War.  Our state and federal legislators need to be reminded that this kind of cash grab behavior aimed at anyone but themselves WILL NOT BE TOLERATED! And we need to mean it.  Your legislators need to be brought to task on this.  They need to be GRILLED on where this proposed tax would go.  How exactly will it benefit those who are paying it and what benefit will it bring to them?  Get the media involved.  I mean REALLY get the media involved.  Start asking all these questions to reporters covering this issue.  If they are not covering it, you need to be asking why.

You guys are sitting on a pivotal moment in history.  Are you going to just watch it happen and whine when it does? Or are you going to do something?  ORGANIZE.  Network, call every vape shop in the state and start planning.  Make posters (might I suggest ""NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION"" to start) and protest like you really mean it.  Tell them that they need to justify such a ridiculous tax.  Suggest instead that they impose it on sugar.  Surely obesity is a much larger problem than e-cigs.

We are ready to stand--at least I am.  As I am sure others are.  This is  a state issue for now, but it's going to grow.  If you let it slide without a huge fight, you are making it easier for them to target the rest of us.  So I/we will help you as best we can I suppose, but you need to organize and work from there.  Please keep updating.  If there is help you need that this community can give, I am sure they will.

Leicester (where this ad is), seems to have a lot more Vapers than anywhere else I've been to in the U.K. IMO, it's more common to see clouds coming out of a car window that smoke. So I'm guessing that this is the reason the local stop smoking services have embraced vaping as a cessation method.

23th3f*This is why people think we're all entitled assholes. Ugh.*"It's strange to wander in this part of Reddit. I sincerely believe that any other subreddit would applaud this type of behavior. If you're not harming others, and you're doing your own thing, even if other people would think it odd, I think other places wouldn't frown on that sort of thinking.

And excuse me for going against the hivemind, but I'm mixed on the reaction here as opposed to other places. Sure, it's always important to think of how your actions will affect others in your own community as far as legislation. But I don't know if I would slam someone for not aiming for that. I don't know if I want to just bow my head and not do anything at all because someday, some amount of people might hold sway on e-cigs, and they're going to suddenly not be on our side because they don't quite like the look of it.


Even if I get downvoted for this, I'm just going to come out and say it:

We live in an oligarchy. The people have little sway on policy at the national and state levels, and none in some of the most important areas where e-cig policy will be decided. These people aren't going to be dissuaded from voting against us or speaking against us because they don't like someone vaping in a hospital, particularly if he wasn't being douchey about it. These are the uneducated, misinformed people who didn't have a high chance of being on our side anyway.

The people who are educated and informed aren't going to let their personal feelings get in the way of civil rights, because that just doesn't make any logical sense, and people who are educated and informed routinely say, ""I don't like X, but I believe that you have the right to do X regardless of my opinion of what that is."" It goes beyond silly things that people around here tend to claim. 

Yeah, if you are making people uncomfortable by vaping close to them, I think you should stop for reasons of politeness, and I think in most public places, it's not something you should even begin to do. But can we please stop pretending that this is somehow going to cause policy to change when I think we all know that it isn't going to make a damn bit of difference except for the people who are going to be influenced more by the negative press anyway? Can we at least not crucify anyone who says, ""You know what? I'm not hurting anyone, and I'm pretty sure I'm not going to bother anyone by doing this, so I'm going to do it.""

They’re mostly adults attempting to stop smoking traditional cigarettes."""*This is like banning flavored alcohol and flavored tobacco, it's absolutely ridiculous. These products arent really aimed towards kids, because most adults I know dont go for tobacco flavor. Alcohol and tobacco kill more people than kids with bad thc vaporizers. Also the news doesn't tell everyone that 76% are 100% related to bad thc vape ingredients such as vitamin E acetate oil being more than 50% and contaminants bein the other 20+% and the rest is unknown. Imagine what the quality of black market e juice will be... just like black market thc cartomizers.
dlh8a9*"New York State: Native-American smoke shops pushing back on flavored e-cigarettes ban, “Our customers are not kids. They’re mostly adults attempting to stop smoking traditional cigarettes."""*Why is this only an issue in america??? Says it all really, it's not vaping that's the problem  it's what ever Americans are putting in the vapes that's the issue. The ban is a joke! The government jst cant be arsed to sort it out. I do feel theres definately hidden motives behind all this. As for protecting children, why the hell is trump going nuts on vapes and not alcohol or cigs? The whole thing is a farse

4ycgag*This comment was too much, I had to share it with you guys.*I was once the only vaper at work. it was a small staff of roughly 8 of us. all but 2 of them smoked. one of the non-smokers was die-hard religious and vocal about how all forms of smoking are wrong. since so many of them smoked, she developed a habit of talking about how bad vaping is. easier to shame the habits of one rather than the whole group. i walked into work one day to find the 4 of them currently on duty standing around talking about how much of a serious epidemic 'popcorn lung disease' is becoming, but people who vape are too busy talking about how good vaping is to notice the problem. i just got busy working and had a good laugh listening to them talking in all seriousness about how deadly vaping is, and how horrible popcorn lung disease would be.

""Five Pawns"" had levels considerably higher than real cigs while others may have lower amounts than real cigs .

So if you believe all e juice has considerably lower levels of diketones than real cigs that is not correct ,  some do , some clearly do not .

AP scares me more than diacetyl does .

My common sense tells me that :

ANYTHING THAT PERMANENTLY SCARS LUNG TISSUE WHICH IS NOT REVERSIBLE IS PROBABLY SOMETHING I SHOULD TRY TO AVOID but thats just me .

Does permanent scarring of lung tissue mean serious health consequences down the line , no it does not but i still prefer to avoid it .

This is straight money that's all it boils down to vaping does not make them the money that smoking does it doesn't make them the money as far as health care goes all of these industries are anti vaping for good reason they rely on the for-profit health system and they rely on their Master Class settlement money.  Hell in some cases to grow more tobacco LOL the amount of regular people that give a Flying Fig about whether or not people can Vape is miniscule however I bet they're going to be bitching their asses off when they start getting cigarette smoke and little Timmy and little Sally's face everywhere they go again because people are no longer vaping because it's illegal or at least hard to get.

Here are the key points regarding this lawsuit:

- NYC C.L.A.S.H. and Russell Wishtart are suing NYC in an effort to nullify the ban on vaping that Bloomberg pushed through last year.

- NYC C.L.A.S.H. was formed 13 years ago as a smokers’ rights group.  Over the last few years, many C.L.A.S.H. members have moved from smoking to vaping.  The activism that C.L.A.S.H. participates in has likewise moved into vaping as well.

- NYC C.L.A.S.H. took the State of NY to court over a smoking ban and won in 2013.  (http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/11/new-york-state-park-smoking-ban/2967991/)

C.L.A.S.H. and their legal team proved that they were able to successfully identify methods used by NY to enact a smoking ban as un-constitutional.  C.L.A.S.H. sued New York and C.L.A.S.H. won.  The law was struck down.  

Just as C.L.A.S.H. beat a smoking ban in NY, we believe that we have an even stronger case that NYC acted in an illegal manner in passing this vaping ban.

- C.L.A.S.H. will be filing suit against NYC with the Joshpe Law Group (http://joshpelaw.com), the same lawyers who took NY to court over the smoking ban and won in 2013.  Joshpe Law has a long track record of protecting the civil liberties of individuals.

- The lawsuit is ready to begin pending receiving funding for the lawsuit.  Two prominent vapers’ rights groups have already pledged significant financial contributions towards this lawsuit: CASAA (The Consumer Advocates for Smoke-free Alternatives Association) and  NVC (National Vapers Club).  Many vapers as well as several ecigarette vendors have also made contributions of all sizes.

-More details of the tactics and strategy that C.L.A.S.H. will use can be found here: http://www.nycclash.com/E-CigLegalFund.html as well as in the interview between Audrey and Russ in this podcast.

20tp48*I am filing a lawsuit against New York City over the Bloomberg vaping ban*"It looks superficially like smoking! It must be bad for you! How do we know what the long term effects are!? 

Because the four ingredients in e-fluid are widely used and known to be safe. We also don't assume that every new thing is dangerous for no reason and then require extensive study in order to prove that it's safe before we allow people to use them. 

Ban cell phones. We don't know what the long term effects of using them are and there are so many varieties that even if some are shown to be safe, others could give everyone cancer. Ban them. Ban everything. That's what the government is for. If it hasn't banned ten things by breakfast, the day is wasted."
20tp48*I am filing a lawsuit against New York City over the Bloomberg vaping ban*"THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS!

And it's about goddamn time someone stood up. I've been saying for a couple of years now that we need to be PROactive instead of REactive to all these bullshit vaping bans.

4dk5f4*Saw this on facebook. Stop buying gimmicky wire, its a massive scam*"This is where I buy my SS316L wire. I also buy all my screws from here.

Flat wire for staple coils

You can also buy 302/304 from here as well with a much larger size selection.

*edit

For anyone who wants to second guess McMaster as a supplier, the SS wire they sell is manufactured by malin CO. It is 316L and 304 and all orders come with a mill number. If you want a material composition report you just ask for one, they are required to give it to you based on the mill number for liability reasons.

If you don't feel safe vaping off this wire over brand name vape wires you dont have to buy from McMaster. But every engineer will vouch for this site."

While I'm in agreement with the results the way he put it out there was utter shit. He didn't bother to explain what XRF is and then faulted a guy for not knowing what it is. I mean come on dude. How many people can see a handheld XRF and immediately identify it. The only reason I knew what it was is because I use XRF sometimes at work and have a chemistry background. He then went on to call people names, that is not how you should conduct yourself in discussions.

4dk5f4*Saw this on facebook. Stop buying gimmicky wire, its a massive scam*"But... It's a proprietary premium alloy blend!! for the best possible vaping experience! totally worth the cost. /s

I'm guilty of having bought ""premium wire"" in the past, although I always had issues with doing it, and it was often when I was out of wire and needed more. But I generally avoided it. For the longest time I tried to convince people in my local vape shop that it's more than likely just repacked wire, but I never had any evidence and couldn't find any information on it. 

It seriously pisses me off that these companies pop up and take advantage of people. To me, it's similar to the AV mods that everyone was hyping about last year and the year before (are they still a thing?) Nearly everyone I knew was dropping $300 on those mods, and they were essentially just aluminum tubes. I knew a guy making minimum wage who was paying ABOVE MSRP for certain colored AV mods and cool buttons he wanted. He had at one point about 6 or 7 of them. I always refused but finally got to join the cool kids club when a friend decided to sell me two of his for much much much cheaper. I used them for all of 4 months. "

4dk5f4*Saw this on facebook. Stop buying gimmicky wire, its a massive scam*"I have always refused to buy premium wire. Anyone who thinks the wire they buy for $10 for 5 feet being anything other than some random bulk wire the seller is buying for less than $10 for 100 feet and repackaging it at a major discount, is just asking to be fooled. 

The fact that most of them won't disclose the type of wire they use should be a dead giveaway that all they are doing is re-branding some form of standard wire. It's just crazier though, because for anyone who cares about ohms law, you cannot accurately gauge in your head just how many wraps you need to get to x ohms. This is also how you get idiots trying to fire .08 ohm coils on 20amp batteries, because they don't realize 5 wraps of that wire is not the same as 5 wraps of 24 gauge Kanthal.

Too many people are just seeing vapers as walking money bags. As long as they come up with fancy names, packaging, and a video showing massive clouds, vapers will line up by the hundreds to hand over the money for that product. Most of them don't question anything, because they trust the seller 100% as being in it for their health."

Both these sources are excellent quality, Kidney Puncher gets their Kanthal from ""the"" Kanthal manufacturer Sandvik.  They also source their SS from Sweden.  All top notch quality wire, no cheap Chinese crap."

There are so many things wrong with this, but the main one that I noticed is the emphasis on synthetic cannabinoids (cannabimimetics).  Yeah, they *can* be dangerous, especially when you smoke (or vaporize) them like you would cannabis.  These cannabimimetics are often much stronger than natural cannabinoids.  They also have plenty of unknown side effects.  But they say that these cannabimimetics aren't going away...  uhm...  legalize pot.  Yes, this turned into a legalize it post.

But seriously.  I've smoked both.  Real weed is much, much better than any synthetic cannabinoid that I've ever had.  Seriously.  Just legalize it.

Anyways, back to vaping.  There's so much wrong with this.  They conflate vaping with vaporizing weed (or cannabimimetics), which is simply false.  Most PVs (as r/electronic_cigarette knows) are used for vaping delicious flavors, as an alternate (and much, much safer than traditional methods) way to consume nicotine, and because...  fun.  And tricks and stuff.

So.  This whole segment was bullshit.

TL;DR: This whole piece is bullshit.  Their arguments are fallacious and rely on false appeals to emotion rather than any sort of facts, and they take many of their ""interview pieces""  out of context."

We all know what the wax and dry herb attachments are used for and it would be foolish to pretend otherwise. If you were in Washington or Colorado then that is fine, but you aren't. In your own words, you said your shop sells as much stuff for smoking weed as it does for nicotine vaping, so I really don't understand all of the outrage for media outlets wanting to cover this.

d3objq*US: Vague Warning to Stop Vaping E-Cigarettes is Incorrect and Irresponsible (another op-ed from Dr. Michael Siegel, a lonely voice in the US calling for evidence/fact based debate)*The big tobacco manufacturers recently went in heavy in vaping, I'm sure they have the money and lobbying power to pull this off and I would bet they are behind all of this. They will ban all flavored vapes, then big tobacco will come out with their 'proven' safe vapes and they will be some of the only ones selling it legally. This is my best guess to the situation.

d3objq*US: Vague Warning to Stop Vaping E-Cigarettes is Incorrect and Irresponsible (another op-ed from Dr. Michael Siegel, a lonely voice in the US calling for evidence/fact based debate)*"Yea there are little to no facts or evidence that traditional vaping will cause immediate or long term harm. Royal college of physicians is the best sample but there are dozens of others.

The deaths associated with the term ""vaping"" is fake news and complete propaganda. The deaths and bad lung infection were caused by someone's homemade thc liquid inside a cheap, off brand, pod device. Thc is not to blame here but the method these nimrods used to extract it does. Many of these pods contained no thc and were other elicit substances. They have actually recently been arrested but no news outlet has said anything about this. Eventhough they continue to say vaping will kill you because 6 people died in the same region at the same time. 

The numbers are something like 6 deaths in 10 years of vaping compared to 5 million from smoking in that time frame. So yes vaping is worse for you than smoking eventhough every non biased study says the opposite. 

Also many states make over a billion dollars from tobacco products every year and vaping harms that number(They make more per pack than the actual tobacco company). Since smoking is at an all time low the government has felt the need to target vaping and get people to smoke again. This will mean more tax money and more sick people so the rich get richer.

Banning flavors is a bad attempt to get kids to start smoking instead of vaping. The teen smoking numbers are at an all time low and vaping is a huge reason for that. Parents need to punish their kids for breaking laws. We shouldn't punish adults for wanting to have a healthier lifestyle. 

Many countries around the world have embraced vaping as the best tool to stop smoking ever invented. They also have found that flavors have made this even more successful because it completely gets rid of anything related to traditional cigarettes. 

The bans show the government does not care about it's people and they only want more of the people's money. If they truly cared they would ban ALL tobacco products like cigarettes, chew, gums, vapes, etc.

Sorry if I have bad grammar I'm just really pissed off with all the fuckwits that believe everything the government says. Eventhough they have no true unbiased evidence to support their claims.

220yfy*How I feel with the media and ecigs right now*This is across the board in news reporting. Last time there was investigative journalism, Nixon got impeached. That was when the media really found that it had more power than the power players were willing to give it. After that it has been one witch hunt after another, with no substance at all. 
220yfy*How I feel with the media and ecigs right now*"I wholeheartedly agree.  In a way though, this is potentially a good sign because it means they are getting pretty desperate at this point.  

They are realizing the word is already out that vaping is safe, so they're grasping at straws... like first it was ""well we don't know enough"" then it was ""lung irritation"" and then ""2nd hand vapor"" and now it's this crap with the juice being poisonous (well duh it's poisonous, and of course there aren't any other household items that are poisonous!!)... and people vaping other substances (this was something brought up on a recent NHPR call-in discussion).  

But it's inevitable that they're going to run out of boogeymen eventually, especially if we keep countering the misinformation and as more people switch to ecigs."

According to the [Utah Code Annotated](http://le.utah.gov/code/TITLE76/htm/76_10_010501.htm), they just lumped e-cigs together with tobacco/cigarette products. According to [this](http://www.tax.utah.gov/forms/pubs/pub-65.pdf), Utah sells cigarettes at $0.085 per stick, while every other tobacco product is at 86%. Why is it that you can be charged 86.5% for a product that contains nicotine, while, at the same time be charged a flat fee of 8.5% for every cigarette you get? At 8.5%, you can get a 20-pack of cigarettes for $1.70. It doesn't make any sense. 

Come on man, a flat rate of 8.5% for a slew of cancer causing substances vs 86.5% for a bottle of e-juice? That doesn't make sense. Also, how would one define cotton and wire in this circumstance? If I buy it at a vape shop it would be taxed at that ridiculous rate. If I buy it anywhere else, the tax wouldn't even apply. 

Just reading through the Utah Code Annotated, it doesn't specifically define electronic cigarettes or (any other e-cig product for that matter) as tobacco products, therefore the 86.5% tax doesn't and shouldn't apply. I may be reading it wrong or I may have missed something. Feel free to correct me. "

This excites me, I hate coil maintenance...It's not even about the money for me.

> We actually tested this with orange soda in the flavor tank - and it actually tasted like vaping orange soda!

This seems a tad dangerous, you probably should not inhale sugar and preservatives. Be careful!

We can put regular e juice in this right? By using one of the two tanks? 

I am VERY interested.

Took your survey, best of luck.

He isn't in favor of banning the flavors, but seems to have issue with the brick and mortars themselves, essentially saying that they're what's drawing the kids into the habit. I responded that enforcement of existing laws is the answer, to which he stated that simply shuttering these stores would be easier altogether, and let the bodegas sell the juices and cigalikes. We're getting it coming and going, folks. None of this makes any sense and the councilpersons already have it ingrained that this city needs to become even more of a nanny-state than it already is.

I have 2 questions. Can you reasonably move out of the country? I have a reasonable amount of mobility (as evidenced by my current address) so I think I would do just that if I found myself in your position. It may seem silly, but I would rather move, than give in to them and start smoking again. As we all know, it will only cost us years of life on the back end, I would rather live longer somewhere else.

And the bigger question, what on earth is the thinking in making it illegal? what is the govt. position? simply that vaping ""may cause cancer""?"

I saw the tracking said it was out for delivery and then put in a claim because  I saw the picture of the packing label that Fasttech posted and it was correct. A few hours later I got a call from a woman from USPS in the local area and assured me that my package would be in my mailbox today and ""packages leave from many different post offices"".

But having said that, one of the reasons I smoked so long was I was sick of the lies.

Smoking is not good for you, but my doctor says:-

Smoking will kill you.  Well, NO, both my parents smoked all their lives and didn't die of anything smoking related not to mention George Burns 16 cigars a day - died at age 100.  All your parents spent the early part of their lives exposed daily to second had smoke, and how may of that generation have you heard of that died of exposure to second hand smoke?

2 Urologist 35 years apart said smoking can give you bladder cancer.  I'll let you look up the side affects of a man having his bladder removed.  My father said it gives a whole new meaning to the term ""Dead Meat"".  And I first heard about this 35 years ago from my fathers Urologist, and then my own Urologist in 2012.  So if I am to believe them, Urologist have known of this problem for 35 years and NOT told the anti smoking people about it?  I mean if the anti smoking people could have said that smoking will give you a limp dick, why haven't they?

BECAUSE IT'S A LIE!

And such transparent lies insult my intelligence, and destroy any credibility the liar might have had.

The problem is that the lie will persist.  It must be true they printed it on that sign over there. 

I was in the hospital last June (people if you can manage it, don't get old).  I was being pushed around the hospital on a gurney by a fellow I hope finds work in some profession out of hospitals.  He asked what was that thing on the lanyard around my neck.  I explained what is was, telling him that it had no tobacco, fire, smoke or any chemicals that could hurt him or me.  He said there had to be something wrong with it.  Then his face brightened and he said, ""There's a battery in it, so there must be radiation."" ?!?!?!?!?!

If it feels good there my be something wrong with it and you will die.  If I wouldn't try it you shouldn't be able to do it.

I've only been asked once to not vape, and that was by a nurse who had never seen an e-cig before and had gotten a complaint from some one else in the room.  I told her what it was and that because of it, I hadn't smoked for 18 months, I finished with I know this can scare people, so I will stop scaring people.  I then moved to a different part of the room, turned the voltage down, vaped but held the vapor in till it didn't show when I exhaled.  Yea, if some one asks nicely, don't give them a reason to come back and tell you again.

BUT When I see signs like this one I want to get all my vaping friends together and blow London fog at it and in the face of anyone who comes to complain.  Because I am sick and tired being treated like a second class citizen based on LIES.

Key conclusions

• Even when compared to workplace standards for involuntary exposures, and using several conservative (erring on the side of caution) assumptions, the exposures from using e-cigarettes fall well below the threshold for concern for compounds with known toxicity. That is, even ignoring the benefits of e-cigarette use and the fact that the exposure is actively chosen, and even comparing to the levels that are considered unacceptable to people who are not benefiting from the exposure and do not want it, the exposures would not generate concern or call for remedial action.

• Expressed concerns about nicotine only apply to vapers who do not wish to consume it; a voluntary (indeed, intentional) exposure is very different from a contaminant.

• There is no serious concern about the contaminants such as volatile organic compounds (formaldehyde, acrolein, etc.) in the liquid or produced by heating. While these contaminants are present, they have been detected at problematic levels only in a few studies that apparently were based on unrealistic levels of heating.

• The frequently stated concern about contamination of the liquid by a nontrivial quantity of ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol remains based on a single sample of an early-technology product (and even this did not rise to the level of health concern) and has not been replicated.

• Tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA) are present in trace quantities and pose no more (likely much less) threat to health than TSNAs from modern smokeless tobacco products, which cause no measurable risk for cancer.

• Contamination by metals is shown to be at similarly trivial levels that pose no health risk, and the alarmist claims about such contamination are based on unrealistic assumptions about the molecular form of these elements.

• The existing literature tends to overestimate the exposures and exaggerate their implications. This is partially due to rhetoric, but also results from technical features. The most important is confusion of the concentration in aerosol, which on its own tells us little about risk to heath, with the relevant and much smaller total exposure to compounds in the aerosol averaged across all air inhaled in the course of a day. There is also clear bias in previous reports in favor of isolated instances of highest level of chemical detected across multiple studies, such that average exposure that can be calculated are higher than true value because they are “missing” all true zeros.

• Routine monitoring of liquid chemistry is easier and cheaper than assessment of aerosols. Combined with an understanding of how the chemistry of the liquid affects the chemistry of the aerosol and insights into behavior of vapers, this can serve as a useful tool to ensure the safety of e-cigarettes.

• The only unintentional exposures (i.e., not the nicotine) that seem to rise to the level that they are worth further research are the carrier chemicals themselves, propylene glycol and glycerin. This exposure is not known to cause health problems, but the magnitude of the exposure is novel and thus is at the levels for concern based on the lack of reassuring data."

This illustrates why I distrust many (not all) aspects and practitioners of modern medicine. They are too deeply intertwined with politics (and Big Pharma, but that’s another topic), to the point where, as demonstrated by that nurse you mentioned, they are now believing government propaganda rather than medical science.

They do the same thing with any type of controlled substance, hence you have doctors that will act as gatekeepers to keep medicine away from a patient who needs it, on the grounds that the patient smokes weed (this has happened to me). Idk if it’s happened yet since Red Flag Laws are so new, but I’ll bet we see some doctors and medical professionals start red flagging people who disclose too much as well.

If medical professionals cared more about their patients than their pocketbooks, and paid more attention to medical science than to government bullshit, then psychiatrists would be giving out psilocybin treatments instead of SSRIs for issues relating to depression and addiction. Psilocybin has been shown to be far, far more effective, achieving complete remission of depression symptoms in upwards of 50% of patients for 6 months or more after single treatment, with virtually no negative side effects. SSRIs are *maybe* slightly more effective than placebo (and even that is highly questionable), have high incidence of negative side effects, and cause people to become dependent on the drug. Did I mention that 95% of mass shooters were taking SSRIs when they committed their atrocious crimes? And yet, SSRIs remain the first-line medical treatment for depression. That alone goes to show how corrupt the medical industry has become."

2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*This is wonderful. I would love to see this as a stickied thread. Everything is explained simply using common beginner terminology, and doesn't lose me at any point. Awsome. Definitely saving this. 
2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"### What is a rebuildable?

A rebuildable is an atomizer that you must wick and coil yourself, as opposed to typical clearomizers (such as the Aspire Nautilus, KangerTech Aerotank, T3D, Smok Aro, etc) which use pre-assembled cartidges.  There are two major types of rebuildables, RDA's (rebuildable dripping atomizers) and RTA's (rebuildable tank atomizers).  The acronym ""RBA"" stands for ReBuildable Atomizer and historically referred to drippers, however since RTA's have been gaining popularity it now can encompass both."
2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"### Wat?

I'm glad you asked.  I'm assuming you mean ""Watts"".  I'll take a second here to delve lightly into how your resistance matters on mechs, and I hope someone else can chime in for regulated mods, since my only regulated mod is my MVP 2.0 which doesn't have a tremendous amount of power.

With regulated mods, you hear a lot of talk about watts.  More watts = more power == more heat.  Think of a lightbulb.  A 100W bulb is much hotter and brighter than a 60W bulb. 

Mechs are beautiful, simple devices.  They have no electronic parts, so short of adding in a ""kick"", the only control you have over the output wattage is via the coil.  This can be both advantageous and cumbersome.  Your voltage will always be dependent on the battery, which will peak at 4.2V and slowly deminish, and hopefully you'll put it on the charger before it gets much lower than 3.6V.  

To calculate your wattage, take your Voltage, square it, and divide by the resistance.  So if you have 4V of power and a 2 ohm coil you would take 4^2 / 2.  This works out to 8 Watts.

Amperage is also a very important number to keep in mind, as you don't want to exceed the ratings of your battery. Know your battery and it's limits.  Amperage is equal to volts divided by resistance.  So, in the previous example, 4 volts over 2 ohms is 2 Amps, and very much within spec of pretty much every IMR out there.  Amperage doesn't come into real consideration until you start talking about subohming and 

[Rapidtables.com](http://www.rapidtables.com/calc/electric/watt-volt-amp-calculator.htm) has a great Watt-Volt-Amp calculator that I also reference quite frequently.

Also keep in mind that mech mods have voltage drop, which is the amount of voltage which is lost through the mod chassis.  [VapingWithTwisted420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTxeRp51cQ0), aside from having a great channel (and a great review of the aforementioned Taifun GT), has a video that discusses and reviews voltage drops on several popular mods.  
"
2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"### Safety

Stay hydrated! This is generally good advice, but it's important to know that vaping can dry you out and lead to faster dehydration.  There is a simple trick to avoiding this, and this time it isn't vodka! It's water! DRINK WATER! 

Lastly, don't be dumb.  Know the limits of your battery and don't push the resistance too low to make big clouds.  You don't want it to vent.  Vaping is much more difficult without lips or cheeks, and we don't need the bad press.  If you need a towel to hold your mod, you're doing it wrong."
2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"### Juice

When dealing with rebuildables, and drippers in particular, juice is important.  High VG Juice becomes much more enjoyable, since you are getting much more flavor and OMG CLOUDS.  PG becomes less important, and infact far less desirable since both the throat hit and the flavor are heavily amplified.  

Most people also cut down their nic level by at least half when using a dripper.  I found the same was true for me using an RDA and an RTA -- I instantly dropped down from 18mg to 6mg.  Even 12mg was unbearably harsh on my throat in my Taifun.  

You *can* cut your juice down with off-the-shelf, food grade (USP) glycerin.  CVS carries this for about $6 for a small bottle in the skin care aisle.  This is what I did.  You will be sacrificing some flavor and will want it to steep a bit before using it again, shaking it 1-2 times a day.  You'll also notice that VG thickens up your juice tremendously.  In my case, after cutting my 18mg juice down to 6mg, I had VERY thick juice. So much so that even the most carefully wicked coil would get dry-hits in my Taifun.  There's a trick to this though...

The trick? Vodka.  Or distilled water.  Vodka, I find convenient because it comes in small bottles and unless you've been pounding it, it's gonna be relatively sterile.  You don't have to buy the good stuff.  I have a 200mL bottle of Karkov that cost me $3 which I'm using to thin my juice out, and generally put it in at a rate of about 10% on an 80VG juice. However, if you're in that 18-21 group, or if you're in recovery, and can't get or don't want to have in your house, your own vodka, Distilled Water works.  Don't use tap water, especially unfiltered tap water.  You don't want to be vaping microbes, chlorine and flouride.
"
2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"### RTA's

Rebuildable tank atomizers are very similar to the clearomizers that vapers are familiar with, but, well, rebuildable.  These give the user more flexibility in resistance, wicking material, coil design, etc.  They also generally give better flavor and vapor production than pre-builts.  There are two very common classes of RTA's:

 - Genesis.  These are RTA's with the coil present on the top.  This is a more classic design, but seems to be fading into obscurity as of late.  Perhaps it will make a comeback like drippers did.  

 - Vacuum, bottom-coil.  These are the more popular ones and include models like the Kayfun, Fogger, and Taifun.The coil is present at the bottom with a small wick extending out into the juice.

The RTA that I use most often is the Taifun GT, a clone which I had purchased from AngelCigs, and what REALLY got me into rebuilding.
"
2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"### Batteries

There are a lot of different batteries out there.  Thankfully, reddit has some tried-and-true favorites.

In the 18650 Class, the most common are typically the Sony VTC4 and VTC5.  These are high-amperage, high-capacity batteries that are safe up to 30 Amps, the VTC5 carrying slightly more capacity.  

For 26650s, MNKE's are very popular around these parts, and are rated at 20A continuous, 60A pulse.

Always look for IMR-chemistry batteries.  ICR is good if you plan on using it in a flashlight or converting your mod to an IED.  Always, Always, ***always*** use IMR until a better technology comes around.  Be mindful of the capacity and don't let your coil exceed 90% of it.  Remember the formula for determining Amps under the ""Wat"" section -- Amps equals volts over resistance.  Ecigs are not the original intended use for these batteries but they will serve quite well as long as you remain within the specifications.

If you find that your battery is getting warm, or if you find that you accidently pocketed your mod without setting the lock ring and your thigh is on fire...take the battery out of the mod and set it aside to cool down. The battery is *probably* safe, unless you notice it leaking or blistering.  A tear on the wrapper alone does not mean the battery is safe.

Also, be mindful of counterfeit batteries.  There has been a rash of these lately with the Sony VTC 5's and Purple Efest batteries.  Best bet is to avoid Purple Efest's altogether at this point since they are typically an inferior battery that has been relabeled to have a higher capacity than it actually does.  This is, quite obviously, dangerous.  VTC4's and VTC5's have been counterfeited as well since they are probably the single most popular vaping battery.  The ""tell-tale"" sign is a seam on the wrapper or being able to see a different wrapper underneath the green skin.  [Sun Vapers](http://www.sun-vapers.com/how-to-spot-a-fake-sony-vtc5-battery/) has a great write-up on spotting a counterfeit VTC5.

Make sure your battery is charged before getting below 3.6V.  These batteries like shallow discharge cycles, meaning don't bring them too low and they'll give you a good long life.  A cheap multimeter, such as one from Harbor Freight, will be a great investment for an intermediate vaper since it will tell you the voltage of the batteries and you can use it to measure your coils once you learn how to use it.  The red probe goes into the ""V"" or +"" jack, the back probe goes into the ""-"" or ""COM"" jack.  Set it to DC Volts on a level higher than ""4"" or ""4000m"" (on my Cen-Tech Harbor Freight Special, that is ""20"").  Place the red on the positive and the black on the negative.  Presto.  

Also invest in a good charger.  You don't have to spend $50 on a good one.  Amazon has Nitecore i4's for under 20 bucks most days, and it is an excellent 4-bay charger which can even handle some 26650s.

2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"### RDA's and Dripping.

Dripping is a means of getting peak flavor and vapor production.  It is, possibly, the purest way to vape.  The dripper contains 1 or more coils stuffed full of a wicking material.  The user will drip fluid into the RDA's and soak it up into the wicks.  The majority of these will consist of several basic parts: 

 - Drip tip. The ""mouthpiece"".  
 - Hood.  This is the top piece that attaches the drip tip to the unit itself.  
 - Base/Build Deck.  This is where the coils go, and usually contains 2 or more screws.  The coils will either be wrappd around the screws themselves, or going through post-holes below the screws.  
 - Juice well.  This, well, holds the juice.  This may be part of the base or may be a separate basin, such as in the Magma RDA.  

The dripper that I use most often currently is the Stillare, and is a clone made by Cigreen.  This is (currently, August 2014) a very popular model around ECR because of it's wide adjustable airflow.  We'll get more into that in a minute.

2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"Excellent guide. One thing that still confuses me is the Micro/Macro/Nano coil  naming conventions. I feel like kicking the kids off my lawn when I hear 'super nano fuckwad sleeping dragon snot cloud coil"" or whatever fucked up name it's been given. "
2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"### Coils? Wicks?

If you open up one of the Kanger-style coils (or at least, one of the older ones with the large ""cup"" gasket on the base of the stem) you will see that it contains a metal coil or two, stuffed full of a tiny wicking material.  When you fire your vaporizer, the coil completes a circuit and heats up, vaporizing the fluid that is soaked into the attached wick.  I chose this as an example because it is common and easy to open.  Another great example is the iClear 30 coils, which you can just remove the top cap from to see the coil, and the long silica wicks protruding down to the bottom of the tank.

It's important to note that finding the best coil and wick is a *personal* journey which requires a lot of experimentation.
"
2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"### Ohms? Parallel? What?

Ohms are the measure of resistance, or how easily electricity can travel through a wire.  Less ohms == less resistance == a hotter, faster heating coil.  With two coils run in parallel (that is, side by side, sharing a positive and a negative), the resistance is equal to the average resistance divided by the number of coils.  Almost always, your coils should have the same individual resistance.  So, in my example above in my Stillare, each individual coil has a total resistance of 0.6 ohms.  Since all the coils are 0.6 ohms, the average is 0.6 ohms.  Divide that by two, and I've got 0.3 ohms.

To visualize this, look up a picture of a classic three-post dripper, such as the Stillare or the Nimbus.  The center post is the positive pin.  Both coils will be using the center post.  The two outer posts are the negative pins, and are attached to the chassis.  Each coil (in a dual-coil, parallel set up) will have their own outer post, which are connected, indirectly, via the chassis.  

A lot of people get confused about the idea of there being less resistance while having more wraps and coils.  On a very basic level, what is happening is you are sending less electricity into the same size tube.  Consider a golf ball through a garden hose versus a hot dog down a hallway.  

[Steam-Engine.org](http://www.steam-engine.org/coil.asp?s=dp&r=0.3&awg=26&id=1.984) has a great coil wrapping calculator which I reference daily.  There are other, similar sites out there, as well as Android and IOS apps to help calculate the resistance of a coil, but it is NO REPLACEMENT for an ohm checker.  You should get one.  They're like, $15.  That's less than two packs of analogs in most places.
"
2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"Beautiful! I'd like to contribute a few things for the wicks section, as well! 

Ekowool is another wicking material that's frequently used in all types of rebuildable atomizers. It's a braided amorphous silica ""rope"" which is temperature stable up to 1,000 degrees Celsius. This means that it is incredibly useful for flavor sampling, because it can simply be dry burned clean. In other applications, it is rather durable for the same reason. It retains liquid well, and wicks with rather good speed. It comes in a variety of diameters, but keep in mind that all diameter measurements of ekowool are the interior diameter because it's a hollow material. 

Stainless steel mesh is another wicking, most commonly used in genesis style atomizers. Mesh comes in a variety of grades (e.g. 350, 400, 500), and these grades refer to the number of steel threads intersecting per inch. It's rather difficult to find ""true"" 500 mesh, but it largely doesn't wick as well as 350 and 400. The general line of thought is that 350 is best for high VG juices, and 400/500 are good for mixtures. Preparing mesh wicks can be difficult, since on its own it shorts out coils. It needs to be annealed, rolled, and burned with juice on it to create an oxidized coating to prevent these shorts and hot spots. 

Stainless steel cable is another wicking material frequently used in genesis styles. This also needs to be torched before use to use. Make sure the cable you get is neither galvanized nor has a nylon thread in them! These things are crazy bad for you if burned. Because of the geometry of SS cable, it needs to have a sock under where the coil goes to prevent hot spots, and to evaporate liquid away evenly. Appropriate socks/sleeves are ekowool and stainless mesh. 

Sorry if it's looking pretty rough, I just woke up and this thread excited me! "
2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"### Airflow

Coils and heat are only part of the picture.  Airflow is another part.  You need substantial airflow to have a good draw and produce a significant amount of vapor.  More air will also cool down the vapor, making it easier to handle.  More air will also promote a larger cloud as it is mixing in with the heated juice.

Too much air, however, can be a bad thing -- especially in vacuum-based tanks such as the Taifun.  You can mod it to increase air-flow, but bear in mind that it does operate on a vacuum, and more airflow means less vacuum and prevents effective wicking.

When building your coils for your RDA's, and for many RTA's (the Taifun included) you want to have your coils positioned directly in the path of the airflow.  With the Taifun, the air comes in directly in the middle of the two posts.  In this design, the coil should be:

 - Centered above the air intake
 - Centered relative to the posts
 - High enough that the center of the coil is level with the wick channels.  

In RDA's, when you place the top cap on, you want the air intake to come directly and un-obstructed into the path of the coils.  This means that there should be no wick between the coil and the air intake.  "
2dy5ev*What I wish I knew about Rebuildables.*"### More on Coils.

Most of the time, when you are starting out, you will be building coils with A1 Kanthal.  Kanthal comes in various thicknesses called gauges.  Lower gauges are thicker, where higher gauges are thinner.  Most people that I've talked to start out building coils with 28 gauge Kanthal, as it's easy to work with and builds fast-heating coils without having very high resistance or very small coils.  

Going up or down in gauge is a trade-off...lower gauges (thicker) offer less resistance, but heat up (and cool down) slower.  The inverse is true for higher gauges.  Once you factor in total surface area, it becomes a careful balancing act to get a coil that's not too hot, not too cold, not too skinny, not too fat, not too short, not too long.  

Your basic coil will be several wraps of kanthal around a firm, known-diameter, circular surface.  Most people use drill bits or 2mm screwdrivers, however people use all sorts of stuff around these parts -- q-tips, toothpicks, zipties, you name it.

In my Taifun, I typically stick around 1-1.2 ohms.  This gives me about 8 wraps of 28 gauge Kanthal around a 5/64"" bit and I find that this is ideal for me.  This is called a micro-coil, due to it's small size.  Most vacuum based RTA's do not have a lot of airflow, so it's not ideal to run a very low resistance coil, as these heat up quickly.

In my Stillare, I prefer a much hotter coil, and run 5-6 wraps of 26 gauge Kanthal around the same 5/64"" bit.  With two of these coils in parallel, I get a total resistance of 0.3 ohms, which is perfect for me.

Some liquids tested positive from companies who have been saying their liquid was free of DA and AP. All test results are now on their website.*"NIOSH recommends that workers in flavoring factories limit their exposure of diacetyl to 5 ppb (parts per **billion**) as a time weighted average during a 40 hour work week.  The maximum short term exposure limit (STEL) is 25 ppb over a 15 minute period.  For acetyl propionyl (2,3-pentanedione) they recommend 9.3 ppb as a time weighted average over a 40 hour work week.  For short term exposure, they recommend 31 ppb over a 15 minute period.  

NIOSH contends that workers exposed to these concentrations will have a 1/1000 chance of contracting a serious lung issue, so they are fairly conservative and safe numbers.  However, notice how the numbers found in eliquid are measured in parts per **million** but the NIOSH recommendations are in parts per **billion.** For those of you who didn't go to school, one billion = 1,000 million.  NIOSH is recommending 5 nanograms (ppb) exposure, not 5 micrograms (ppm)

The popcorn factories where workers became ill were studied and air samples were taken.  They then calculated the amount of diacetyl (in ppm) found in the air.  In the mixing room, they found an average of **57 ppm.**  In other words, the workers who became ill (and need lung transplants) were only exposed to an average of 57 ppm of diacetyl (yes, they were exposed for 8 hours a day). 

Let's say you vape 5mL of Beard's #51 per day.  Since there is 1843 micrograms per milliliter (ug/mL) of AP in that liquid (or 1843 ppm), this means you would be inhaling 9,215 micrograms per day or 64,505 micrograms per week.  That's 64,505,000 nanograms per week.  So, at 5mL a day, you get 9,215 micrograms.  9215/24 = 384 ug per hour.  384/4 = 96 ug per 15 minutes.  The STEL (15 minute exposure limit) for AP is 31 ppb or 31 nanograms.  Therefore, the 15 minute exposure from vaping would be 96,000 nanograms compared to the NIOSH recommendation of 31 nanograms.

If anyone more experienced with TWA (time weighted averages) and exactly how they work wants to do the math or correct me, please do.  However, I am fairly certain that 1845 ug/mL is much higher than the suggested 9 ppb recommendation from NIOSH.

32hkvb*"Truth About Vaping - Episode 1 ""Why They Hate Us"""*"Here are some good links.  I was preparing a part of this argument all morning for my local supervisor (he cancelled on me an hour before the meeting).

Propublica 

http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/tbcbonds-statemap
http://www.propublica.org/article/how-wall-street-tobacco-deals-left-states-with-billions-in-toxic-debt

-Office of the California treasurer regarding debt obligations, pay attention to Golden State Tobacco Securitization Corporation, they sold and continue to sell the bonds we can't pay for.

http://www.treasurer.ca.gov/tfba/index.asp

-The same treasurer selling off 1.7b in bonds through this corporation.  

http://goldenstatetsc.org/20150313.pdf

-These bonds were sold within the last month.  What is also special about this is the taxpayers are backing these ones and using the funds to pay down the ones that aren't backed by taxpayers.  It's a wall street giveaway worth billions since the old ones are money losers at the moment.  
  ""This week, California's Golden State Tobacco Securitization Corp. will be coming to market with its $1.7 billion tobacco bond deal.

  The bonds are enhanced by a pledge from the state to seek an annual appropriation for debt service and operating expenses should settlement payments fall short. Proceeds will be used to repay existing tobacco bonds that do not benefit from a pledge from the state and so are more vulnerable to a shortfall in settlement payments.""

http://www.bondbuyer.com/news/markets-news/tobacco-bond-issuers-refinance-amid-smoking-decline-1071663-1.html

-These bonds are special because they don't need voter approval in the state of California.  This according to  California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission.
Who they are, I don't know.  I'm particularly interested in footnote 14 that cites ""California Budget Project Budget Brief, Borrowing Against the Future: Is Securitizing California’s Tobacco Settlement Revenues the Best Way to Close the
Budget Gap?""  I have looked for this paper and have not been able to find it.

32hkvb*"Truth About Vaping - Episode 1 ""Why They Hate Us"""*"Great video! Ecigs have unveiled the extent of greed and hypocrisy from the various players that stand to lose from it. I think the profit driven corruption of the healthcare industry has shown, rarely so blatantly, its quite ugly side. And the fed/state govts, arrogantly trying to tax and get their cut of the money, without a second thought to the citizens.

There's no need for the government in my opinion, assuming health risks are much lower than tobacco. The ecig industry could be self regulating and to an extent is, as we share information and more science is funded.

There's too much money at stake and I honestly doubt we're going to get out of this without some sort of financial hit. Its going to be interesting how it plays out."

9p0hvj*Vuse Alto Cartridge Not Firing/Working*"I know this is an old post, but since I just found it by google when I had this same problem, I figured I'd say how I got my broken cartridge to work.

&#x200B;

I banged the metal part on the counter a couple times, started working again just fine. Good ol' percussive maintenance haha"
9p0hvj*Vuse Alto Cartridge Not Firing/Working*Try and push down a little harder on the pod to reset the connection. If that doesn’t work, call the number on the box and they will send you a refund. It’s completely guaranteed 
9p0hvj*Vuse Alto Cartridge Not Firing/Working*same thing just happened to mine. NO Idea what happened.
9p0hvj*Vuse Alto Cartridge Not Firing/Working*Mine did the same thing!!! It was working fine then it just stopped!
9p0hvj*Vuse Alto Cartridge Not Firing/Working*Mines doing the same thing. I just recently bought a new pack of pods and both worked till they got halfway empty and then both stopped working. And it looks just like my other pods. I’m really disappointed. Did you figure out how to fix them? I can’t buy new ones till I get payed again.

9p0hvj*Vuse Alto Cartridge Not Firing/Working*Man I’m in a camp and mine started blinking 3 times after I dropped it I was worried then I hit the bastard on the table and it works again !!! Niccce
9p0hvj*Vuse Alto Cartridge Not Firing/Working*Hey peeps ! For those of you who banging the pod doesn’t I found out that if you have an empty working pod, you pop the bottom part of it with a small screw diver, then take out the electric part a replace it with your empty working it one it will work ! This is a bit of struggle to do but when banging it doesn’t work it’s worth it !

Bottom piece pops off, the plastic is very cheap, if you put pressure on the stig writing, plastic will bend down. Blue light shows although it doesn’t hit, you just get air. Waste of money,  came in the stig packaging, not the box. Packaging looked identical to a real one. Sadly, I wasted $30 on 4 of these fake ones. Don’t make the same mistake.

eprokb*Pax 2 or Da Buddha vape??*I’ve loved my DBV for a looooong time now and it’s still a HEAVY hitter with the stock wand. The DDave mod allows for smaller bowls and even single hit micro bowls (14mm wand) for conservation. I Recently added a Dynavap to my collection and am loving it so far. From my few experiences with PAX products is that they are pretty lackluster for the price. You definitely won’t get the same results from that as you have been with your DBV.
eprokb*Pax 2 or Da Buddha vape??*I am team Pax 2, all the way!  Gives you a very flavourful vapour, an even burn, and just the purest hit. The design is sleek enough to just drop it in your pocket. Hands down the best vaporizer I have seen.

7u5pzc*Wanting to know what tank is the best with a coil that is optimised for 12-17wattage.*If you want coils that last then disposable coil tanks aren't there way to go in my opinion. If I were you I'd go for a mouth to lung rta and build your own. At that wattage you wouldn't have to build a new one often at all, and you could build a high resistance coil perfectly suited to your vaping preference
