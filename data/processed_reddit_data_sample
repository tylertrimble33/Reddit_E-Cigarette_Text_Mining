try  My second piece of advice is  if the first piece of advice is ignored   start small and gradually move on to bigger things  Anal bleeding ruins many articles of clothing including but not limited to socks and shoes  Actually  while we   re on the topic of anal stretching and clothes being ruined  you should know once the anus is stretched beyond 8 cm  the sphincter is rendered useless  Gravity will just pull turds right out of your ass with no regard for anything  If your diet is fiber rich  this may not be as big of a problem  as solid turds can be easily disposed  However  if you are a fan of taco bell  be warned that splash damage is a very real thing  It   s best during the anal stretching period to invest in a wide range of butt plugs   Not only will this stem the tide of fecal matter making dramatic exits through what can only be described as an industrial laundry chute  but with the proper fitment the plugs will maintain your latest stretch during downtime  Proper resting with a press fit butt plug is good and allows the body to accept the new monstrosity that is the size of your asshole  Anal fissures are a by product of stretching too rapidly without the necessary downtime and recovery  Anal fissures are extremely painful  especially when infected by wet bowel movements  The only benefit of anal stretching is lack of fart noise  Like a balloon stem  the known fart noise is caused by air movement vibrating the orifice it exits  Noise intensity are directly proportional to air speed velocity  while harshness of pitch is indirectly proportional to size of hole  With an escape hatch the size of a mini sub  air speed velocity is virtually zero  thus no noise is heard  Any gas produced by the body and exiting the colon tends to just waft out as produced  I   m not even sure the action of    farting    is a thing when your asshole can fit a small adult inside of it  I suppose technically there is some air movement  but it would be no more significant than running a leaf blower through the grand canyon  Finally  it should be cautioned to never leave your expanded asshole uncovered  as birds  fish  and reptiles will nest in discovered cave dwellings  This then becomes a health and safety violation in many public settings that is best to generally avoid  I personally recommend having a sealed traffic cone or small inflatable raft handy when leaving your asshole alone for more than 5 minutes  Butt plugs are an option but only if you are staying under 24 centimeters in diameter  Greater than 24 centimeters  and the butt plug industry will have to create a custom sized plug  which is costly and generally best to avoid   So in conclusion  when going to the extremes of anal stretching  keep realistic goals  but always prepare ahead of time for a size you may think unattainable  Your anus will surprise you *asshole fit car tire anyone actually reads keep mind average asshole human dilate 2 4 centimeters one car tire roughly 500x200

776*One of the worst parts about the ban in SF is that the city is completely ignoring the basis of what vaping is  The major point of vaping is to get people off cigarettes  period  Without the means of buying new vapes  juice  tools  supplies  etc  most vapers in the city will turn to cigarettes  it is only a matter of time    Vape shops in the city have been shutting down and disappearing for years  and this ban is the final push that will put the rest of the vape shops in the city out of business  Even though the price of e juice has dropped significantly in recent years  all the other state and local regulations have severely damaged the vaping industry not just in SF  but the Bay Area as a whole  Seriously  you can   t even go into a vape shop and get a fresh build try new juices at shops nowadays    The whole point of this new ban in SF is to prevent children from vaping but since when did trying to stop children from doing anything actually help that cause  Teenagers will smoke cigarettes  drink alcohol  all that teenage shit because that   s what teenagers do  The point is that we guide them to live better and healthier lives  and banning the sale of e cigarettes as well as shipments into the city has not contributed to that cause  Once again  they will simply turn to cigarettes to get their nicotine fix    While e cigarettes are not the perfect alternative to cigarettes  they are a start  While there are no legitimate long term studies on vaping  we still don   t know the health impacts of vaping general VG PG based juice  However  there is concern when Juul is coming out with cartridges that are testing out at  55 mg mL nicotine levels    Ultimately  it is not e cigarettes that are the problem  rather bad legislation and regulations that have almost put most vape shops out of business  If the problem truly lies with children  then put regulations on the nicotine content inside the devices  not the device itself  55 mg mL is way too much nicotine for any single person and definitely not safe for children *one worst parts ban sf city completely ignoring basis major point get people cigarettes period without means buying new vapes juice tools supplies etc vapers city turn cigarettes matter time shops city shutting disappearing years ban final push put rest shops city business even though price e juice dropped significantly recent years state local regulations severely damaged industry sf bay area whole seriously even go shop get fresh build try new juices shops nowadays whole point new ban sf prevent children since trying stop children anything actually help cause teenagers smoke cigarettes drink alcohol teenage shit teenagers point guide live better healthier lives banning sale e cigarettes well shipments city contributed cause simply turn cigarettes get nicotine fix e cigarettes perfect alternative cigarettes start legitimate long term studies still know health impacts general vg pg based juice however concern juul coming cartridges testing 55 mg ml nicotine levels ultimately e cigarettes problem rather bad legislation regulations almost put shops business problem truly lies children put regulations nicotine content inside devices device 55 mg ml way much nicotine single person definitely safe children

844*I   m an addict in recovery  I   ve overdosed on opioids twice  I   ve been clean for 1 year and 7 months and part of the reason I   ve been able to stay clean is that I vape and it   s something of an outlet for stress  frustration  etc  It has a calming effect for me  It   s also become somewhat of a hobby  I honestly don   t know at this point what the government can do for opioid addiction bc the cat   s out of the bag  Once people know there   s something that can make them feel that way  it   s very difficult to take it back and act like it never happened  That   s why it   s so hard to get clean  And sick hurt people actually need those meds so you can   t eradicate them completely  One of the people that sold to me after I lost my scripts  broke my back in a car accident and got endless scripts till my first OD  was a cancer patient  Fentanyl used to be something you could almost never get on the street and was insanely expensive if you could actually find it and now it   s like everywhere  Idk how they can fix it but that   s what they should be focusing on  Not vape flavors  I mean yeah  get control of the kids but not at the expense of millions of adults  I need my vape and flavors  They don   t realize how many lives they   re going to fuck up with these bans  Or actually  they probably do  they just don   t care  They want their MSA payments and for vaping to disappear  We can   t let that happen *addict recovery overdosed opioids twice clean 1 year 7 months part reason able stay clean something outlet stress frustration etc calming effect also become somewhat hobby honestly know point government opioid addiction bc cat bag people know something make feel way difficult take back act like never happened hard get clean sick hurt people actually need meds eradicate completely one people sold lost scripts broke back car accident got endless scripts till first od cancer patient fentanyl used something could almost never get street insanely expensive could actually find like everywhere idk fix focusing flavors mean yeah get control kids expense millions adults need flavors realize many lives going fuck bans actually probably care want msa payments disappear let happen

1101*Honestly  this is the type of thing thats just as bad as the other side saying ecigs with diacetyl cause popcorn lung    There has not been enough studies done to determine if smoking causes popcorn lung  Basically  if you smoke and have lung issues its put under the umbrella of COPD  Diacetyl in smoke could be causing popcorn lung  but the other effects of smoking like tar buildup are a greater immediate concern for doctors    There is also a difference in how the diacetyl is delivered  In smoking it is a particle of the smoke composition  In vaping its carried to the lungs in the transport of pg vg  There has not been enough studies to indicate if the diacetyl in vaping with a transport is different or less harmful than if a byproduct of combustion     No concern  should not be used   Comparing to smoking is a decent first step if making this argument  But  it should be followed by the case of the popcorn factory workers  There were a lot of workers constantly exposed to diacetyl on a normal basis  It was in a different form  as a solid  compared to vapor or smoke byproduct   But  only the workers who put themselves at extreme risk  putting their head into a barrel of the popcorn flavoring  and deeply inhaling  for extended periods of time  years  were diagnosed with popcorn lung  The other workers who had much lower exposure did not have any complications   Propaganda needs to stop on both sides  Just facts should be used  and opinions like  no concern  without studies to back it up are just harmful to any argument discussion   Key take away should be we need more scientifically sound studies done    If somebody says  that shit is worse than smoking  your only reply should be  I   know   smoking   will     kill   me  vaping seems less harmful because I can breathe better and feel better since switching  *honestly type thing thats bad side saying ecigs diacetyl cause popcorn lung enough studies done determine smoking causes popcorn lung basically smoke lung issues put umbrella copd diacetyl smoke could causing popcorn lung effects smoking like tar buildup greater immediate concern doctors also difference diacetyl delivered smoking particle smoke composition carried lungs transport pg vg enough studies indicate diacetyl transport different less harmful byproduct combustion concern used comparing smoking decent first step making argument followed case popcorn factory workers lot workers constantly exposed diacetyl normal basis different form solid compared vapor smoke byproduct workers put extreme risk putting head barrel popcorn flavoring deeply inhaling extended periods time years diagnosed popcorn lung workers much lower exposure complications propaganda needs stop sides facts used opinions like concern without studies back harmful argument discussion key take away need scientifically sound studies done somebody says shit worse smoking reply know smoking kill seems less harmful breathe better feel better since switching

1107*This is great  Before I started vaping I had done research on this because I had heard about it  After reading about the absurd amount in cigarettes and the minuscule amount in the    worst    e juice I had no problem switching to vaping  On the first day I came to work almost every one started saying     you   re going to get popcorn lung        how can you do that with all those fact about getting popcorn lung        don   t you know those thing blow up all the Tim     And so on and so forth  Every time they would say these thing I would take out my phone and bring up one of the many articles that I bookmarked for just such an occasion and had them read it Most of them realized how wrong they are and stoped bringing it up  two of the guys that read it actually ended up switching to vaping because of me showing them the articles  It   s been 3 years now since I made the switch and I couldn   t be happier  I   ll never look back *great started done research heard reading absurd amount cigarettes minuscule amount worst e juice problem switching first day came work almost every one started saying going get popcorn lung fact getting popcorn lung know thing blow tim forth every time would say thing would take phone bring one many articles bookmarked occasion read realized wrong stoped bringing two guys read actually ended switching showing articles 3 years since made switch happier never look back
1108*The amount of disgusting misleading propaganda out there against vaping is unsettling  And the medias way of using this misinformation just to get clickbait headlines is the worst culprit imaginable  As said above  SMOKERS at risk of countless problems and diseases are afraid to try vaping because of the bullshit scare of popcorn lung  Meanwhile they keep sucking away on guaranteed illnesses  some far greater than popcorn lung  Thats powerful fear mongering  Hopefully we will see some reason and logic used when the FDA decides to bring down the hammer *amount disgusting misleading propaganda unsettling medias way using misinformation get clickbait headlines worst culprit imaginable said smokers risk countless problems diseases afraid try bullshit scare popcorn lung meanwhile keep sucking away guaranteed illnesses far greater popcorn lung thats powerful fear mongering hopefully see reason logic used fda decides bring hammer

1153*In my late teens I had quite a few friends who smoked  I was the first to turn 18  so for about 6 months I would always be buying my friends their pack of smokes     I had already smoked a few times when I was 11   12  One of my friends at that age wanted some cigarettes  cause apparently he stole a few from his dad once in awhile   Anyhow this was back in the day 92 93 when cigarettes were displayed in racks in front of the cash register  so customers could just grab the brand they wanted instead of asking the cashier for them   So I just pocketed a pack for my friend when I went up to buy a soda  And smoked a couple with him    Anyhow when I was 18 I got in the habit of charging my friends a tax of 1 or 2 smokes out of their pack for buying them cigarettes   After about a month I was buying my own packs   Ever since then I never successfully quitted smoking for longer than 3 days  I smoked between 1 4 2 packs a day for 20 years   The majority of the time I smoked a little over a pack a day    Ive been vaping since 2016  but I also still smoked   Vaping did allow me to drop my pack a day habit down to 4 8 cigarettes a day the past 2 years and down to 2 cigarettes a day the last 2 months I smoked    I finally kicked the habit for good in May this year   Been completely tobacco free for almost 4 months now   My blood pressure and resting heart rate has improved signifigantly     And best of all  I dont have to wash my face 10 times a day to get that cat piss smell out of my moustache     What did it for good was the flavors  I stopped shopping at my local vape shop because the juice is overpriced and they have a shitty selection of premium juice  Thats why I kept buying cigarettes   I wasnt getting enough of what i needed out of vaping  and what I needed was good flavors and variety   So I started buying juice online for significantly cheaper prices    Also switching to rebuildables has helped tremendously   I dont have to replace a coil every 2 days  and I get better flavor  consistently  and Im saving a lot of money thats going towards juice and not shitty disposable coils *late teens quite friends smoked first turn 18 6 months would always buying friends pack smokes already smoked times 11 12 one friends age wanted cigarettes cause apparently stole dad awhile anyhow back day 92 93 cigarettes displayed racks front cash register customers could grab brand wanted instead asking cashier pocketed pack friend went buy soda smoked couple anyhow 18 got habit charging friends tax 1 2 smokes pack buying cigarettes month buying packs ever since never successfully quitted smoking longer 3 days smoked 1 4 2 packs day 20 years majority time smoked little pack day ive since 2016 also still smoked allow drop pack day habit 4 8 cigarettes day past 2 years 2 cigarettes day last 2 months smoked finally kicked habit good may year completely tobacco free almost 4 months blood pressure resting heart rate improved signifigantly best dont wash face 10 times day get cat piss smell moustache good flavors stopped shopping local shop juice overpriced shitty selection premium juice thats kept buying cigarettes wasnt getting enough needed needed good flavors variety started buying juice online significantly cheaper prices also switching rebuildables helped tremendously dont replace coil every 2 days get better flavor consistently im saving lot money thats going towards juice shitty disposable coils

1515*Whether theyre banned or not  one things for sure  that business will continue to sell cigarettes  I disagree with any legislation limiting access to ecigs  Not everyone that legitimately wants to quit tobacco gives a shit about vaping  But they might give it a try if its on the shelf next to the cigs at the store they already go to*whether theyre banned one things sure business continue sell cigarettes disagree legislation limiting access ecigs everyone legitimately wants quit tobacco gives shit might give try shelf next cigs store already go
1517*Now thats a smart move  I hope the states which have already banned vape will think about that and let people buy safe juice in vape shops too  instead of a stupid and dangerous ban  And I hope vape shops  everywhere  will play fair for everyone to be safe  Its very important that they are responsible  so vape can become something everyone could trust   Id like to help you American vapers to stop the ban  Is there anyway for me  in EU  to help  *thats smart move hope states already banned think let people buy safe juice shops instead stupid dangerous ban hope shops everywhere play fair everyone safe important responsible become something everyone could trust id like help american vapers stop ban anyway eu help

2403*What I have come to realize with Smok is that the very first batch of a new product they put out are absolutely fantastic  but the more they make of the device the cheaper they make them  Ive worked in a vape shop for about 2 and a half years and I   ve seen many of their products come in and the issues they   ve had  I personally had that experience around August of last year  I bought a Novo the first day we got them in and that thing was absolutely amazing  I used that device exclusively for about 4 months  About a month or so after I bought my first one  I bought a second as a backup  It was the same color  and the second one didn   t hit the same  when you looked inside where the pod makes connection was different  they overall didn   t function the same  AND the thing that gets me the most was that there was a noticeable weight difference  The second one was so much lighter  In the time frame we   ve had them  not long after I noticed these details about my second one  the people that purchased them around the same time and after have had the same issues I have  Their quality control is straight up garbage  ESPECIALLY on their coils  You pretty much have a 50 50 shot of getting a good or a bad coil  but I will commend them on the mesh coils  They majority of them last an average coil lifespan  Out of the Smok I   ve encountered the only ones I personally recommend are the x cube  alien  t priv  baby big baby with strictly mesh coils  the prince tank strictly with mesh coils  and the baby v2 tank  Smok was amazing back in the day  but unfortunately they have gone to caring about mass producing rather than the quality of the item they   re making and that makes me sad *come realize smok first batch new product put absolutely fantastic make device cheaper make ive worked shop 2 half years seen many products come issues personally experience around august last year bought novo first day got thing absolutely amazing used device exclusively 4 months month bought first one bought second backup color second one hit looked inside pod makes connection different overall function thing gets noticeable weight difference second one much lighter time frame long noticed details second one people purchased around time issues quality control straight garbage especially coils pretty much 50 50 shot getting good bad coil commend mesh coils majority last average coil lifespan smok encountered ones personally recommend x cube alien priv baby big baby strictly mesh coils prince tank strictly mesh coils baby v2 tank smok amazing back day unfortunately gone caring mass producing rather quality item making makes sad

3515*Virtually everyone here started on an eGo battery combo of one style or another  so dont let anyone tell you that you bought the wrong equipment  If it keeps you from cigarettes  it is the right equipment   My first was an eGo 900mAh and Protank 2 mini kit from Vape Dojo  Eventually I upgraded and passed my eGo kit to a co worker who is now 3 months free from cigarettes and has passed the kit on himself *virtually everyone started ego battery combo one style another dont let anyone tell bought wrong equipment keeps cigarettes right equipment first ego 900mah protank 2 mini kit dojo eventually upgraded passed ego kit co worker 3 months free cigarettes passed kit

3519*It   s not a fashion show    if it works for you  well  then it works   And if you   re happy with it  that   s all that matters   One of the big pluses of vaping gear is the interchangeability   So if you want more than 1 6ml of liquid you can add a different clearomizer  Hell  even an Aspire Nautilus  5ml capacity  can be used with an eGo style battery  It looks a little funny  but it works *fashion show works well works happy matters one big pluses gear interchangeability want 1 6ml liquid add different clearomizer hell even aspire nautilus 5ml capacity used ego style battery looks little funny works

3540*Good post  Ive recently changed to vaping from analogs after 30 years smoking up to 50 a day  I asked for advice in here and the answer could have been in Russian for all I understood  Thankfully the guy came back and explained the terms he used  I got a starter kit Tornade mega ecog  from a friend to see if Id like it  he never   Ill probably buy a better kit soon  but to say Im still uncertain about what to buy is an understatement  And if I spend   100 I want to be as sure as I can be  I am techy also  *good post ive recently changed analogs 30 years smoking 50 day asked advice answer could russian understood thankfully guy came back explained terms used got starter kit tornade mega ecog friend see id like never ill probably buy better kit soon say im still uncertain buy understatement spend 100 want sure techy also
3542*I found the hardest part about getting people to vape instead of smoke is indeed the learning of new technologies  learning the jargon we use  and the maintenance  A cigarette doesnt leak  You can grab a pack almost anywhere  You dont have to worry about charging it  If a pack get stomped wet you just drop another  5  9  It is instant gratification at a moments notice  This is the reason I think most people have a harder time transitioning   If someone get a disposable from a gas station and it doesnt last long or they grab an ego kit and it breaks in a week or two  they get put off  If they arnt informed that you have to replace the coil clearo they think they just wasted money and go back to smoking   Education is the hardest part and transition to something new is even harder  I am surprised at how many vape veterans there are since they had it pretty rough a few years back  I dont know if when I started  I would have gone to the lengths they did to vape *found hardest part getting people instead smoke indeed learning new technologies learning jargon use maintenance cigarette doesnt leak grab pack almost anywhere dont worry charging pack get stomped wet drop another 5 9 instant gratification moments notice reason think people harder time transitioning someone get disposable gas station doesnt last long grab ego kit breaks week two get put arnt informed replace coil clearo think wasted money go back smoking education hardest part transition something new even harder surprised many veterans since pretty rough years back dont know started would gone lengths
3543*Also  I should ad two things    1  Its only specific to Switzerland but here  juice with nicotine is illegal  It means you can only buy juice without nicotine in any store  If you want some  you can order online but again it makes it harder   You have to plan how often you will order and how much you need  And if you dont have anymore juice  you cant just go to a shop and quickly buy a little bottle   2  God knows how much I like my MVP  it really fits my need on an everyday vape  But again  why  when I want to know my battery status  I see 4 2V to 3 6V   Yeah  I understand this  but my mother wouldnt at all   Just show it with a percent  *also ad two things 1 specific switzerland juice nicotine illegal means buy juice without nicotine store want order online makes harder plan often order much need dont anymore juice cant go shop quickly buy little bottle 2 god knows much like mvp really fits need everyday want know battery status see 4 2v 3 6v yeah understand mother wouldnt show percent
3545*Good points  I agree  Sometimes I think Apple ought to just make one     Also  I thought your ESL English was adorable *good points agree sometimes think apple ought make one also thought esl english adorable
3547*Agree     I started with a shot in the dark  how complicated could it be  almost impulse buy   I was at a local tobacco shop  and asked the owner his opinion  He recommended a Blow One   It was most unsatisfying   The battery life was poor  the taste was unimpressive  though this could also have been a product of the juice I bought at the time   the airflow was severely lacking    I could have gotten just about as much out of sucking on a straw   Rather than give up on the idea  I did some reading online and headed to the nearest vape shop  Now  armed with a Beyond Vape Spire  and Kanger Protank 3  I am far more satisfied  and replacing an ever increasing amount of my classic cigarette use with vaping   But it should be easier for a newcomer to get something that   s going to satisfy   The market needs something priced low enough to be carried at a local tobacco liquor shop  but capable enough not to disappoint   To be fair  I probably wouldn   t have  as many  complaints about the Blow One if I had started vaping as a non smoker  A lot of my dissatisfaction came from comparing the experiences *agree started shot dark complicated could almost impulse buy local tobacco shop asked owner opinion recommended blow one unsatisfying battery life poor taste unimpressive though could also product juice bought time airflow severely lacking could gotten much sucking straw rather give idea reading online headed nearest shop armed beyond spire kanger protank 3 far satisfied replacing ever increasing amount classic cigarette use easier newcomer get something going satisfy market needs something priced low enough carried local tobacco liquor shop capable enough disappoint fair probably many complaints blow one started non smoker lot dissatisfaction came comparing experiences
3548*If it wasnt for my friend I would not have known where to start  It felt like starting a new hobby to me with so many different models  terminology  cleaning  picking juices  etc  Thanks to him I got an awesome set up  aerotank with evic  as my first ecig  Now I want to try and get my family members who are smokers to make the switch  *wasnt friend would known start felt like starting new hobby many different models terminology cleaning picking juices etc thanks got awesome set aerotank evic first want try get family members smokers make switch
3549*I recently started vaping  been a smoker for almost 20 years now  I stumbled upon a product called  ploom  which you can get for less than 30 Euros in any cigarette store here in Austria  In fact  the thing is manufactured and sold by JTI  one of the largest tobacco companies in the world and current holder of the Austrian tobacco license    They dont use liquids but tiny Nespresso like pods filled with grained tobacco  The vaporizer itself is about as long as a middle finger and some  available in black or white  You charge it with a magnetic USB adapter  As said  the vaporizer with USB charger comes for 29    a pack with 12 pods for 5    The reason I impulsively went for it as soon as I noticed the display in the cig shop was  that you get those pods where you would get cigarettes  practically everywhere  Depending on the flavour  it is close to the real thing  The steam feels like smoke and you can puff  But of course  it doesnt stink nor turn anything yellow  Its also about three times cheaper than cigs  depending on your habit   I havent smoked a real cig since I have it  The thing looks somewhat stylish  is very light  The white version almost gives that    Apple    vibe you werte talking about  Its about as user friendly as it can get  Granted  you have a power source nearby   Still deliberating about trying liquids  But there are too many options online to decide where to go  It seems as if everybody and their mothers are dabbling with selling those vaporizers now  Any recommendations are appreciated   If you want a quick  cheap and somewhat stylish vaporizer with widely available fills I can recommend that Ploom stuff  It also successfully vaporizes marihuana  but youll might want to get the fermented stuff  which is harder to come by and harder to make than the regular dry greenie   *recently started smoker almost 20 years stumbled upon product called ploom get less 30 euros cigarette store austria fact thing manufactured sold jti one largest tobacco companies world current holder austrian tobacco license dont use liquids tiny nespresso like pods filled grained tobacco vaporizer long middle finger available black white charge magnetic usb adapter said vaporizer usb charger comes 29 pack 12 pods 5 reason impulsively went soon noticed display cig shop get pods would get cigarettes practically everywhere depending flavour close real thing steam feels like smoke puff course doesnt stink turn anything yellow also three times cheaper cigs depending habit havent smoked real cig since thing looks somewhat stylish light white version almost gives apple vibe werte talking user friendly get granted power source nearby still deliberating trying liquids many options online decide go seems everybody mothers dabbling selling vaporizers recommendations appreciated want quick cheap somewhat stylish vaporizer widely available fills recommend ploom stuff also successfully vaporizes marihuana youll might want get fermented stuff harder come harder make regular dry greenie
3550*I think i may know a concept that could potentially be a sollution  Lets say we have a metal battery that is about the size of an 18650  but they could also have alternative sizes depending on how big you wanted it to be but for the sake of this post lets say 18650 is top of the line size  on that there is a small button similar to that of an ego twist that is easily accessible  not on the bottom like most mech mods now a days  Then on the bottom is a similar twist to change the voltage to make it hit harder like an ego except on each turn it locks in to an extent so it isnt between voltages you know exactly what it is  then with the tank there is twistable airflow to get harder hits off depending on how much you would like to inhale  The company could then sell liquid attached to the drip tip that heats up inside the twistable airflow  except the whole drip tip liquid carton combo is disposable so whenever you run out or want to replace the flavor you just pull it out and put the other one in so the battery and tank is together and you dont have too many moving parts  With that you could also buy wider or skinnier drip tips to get the proper pull you would like  finally to charge it all you would have to do is pop a cap up on the bottom and plug it in  Voila ultimate sollution and my guess is the whole combo itself wouldnt cost more than  50 or  60 to get a nice  non moving starting kit *think may know concept could potentially sollution lets say metal battery size 18650 could also alternative sizes depending big wanted sake post lets say 18650 top line size small button similar ego twist easily accessible bottom like mech mods days bottom similar twist change voltage make hit harder like ego except turn locks extent isnt voltages know exactly tank twistable airflow get harder hits depending much would like inhale company could sell liquid attached drip tip heats inside twistable airflow except whole drip tip liquid carton combo disposable whenever run want replace flavor pull put one battery tank together dont many moving parts could also buy wider skinnier drip tips get proper pull would like finally charge would pop cap bottom plug voila ultimate sollution guess whole combo wouldnt cost 50 60 get nice non moving starting kit
3551*Well written post   I just switched to vaping after 20  years of smoking   I did some research and thought I was way ahead of most beginners by getting a Halo Triton starter kit   Then I started looking into it more and realize I could have done better   However  when I started I would not have been able to wrap my head around a box looking mod like a MVP2   The maintenance and variation of maintenance between tanks etc    is quite confusing   Some juice cracks plastic tanks how do you know which  How do you know when to change coils  All of these things are confusing to novices and there is almost too much info  if that is possible  out there      I am still not sure what I should upgrade to   I just know Id like a better product   An MVP2 or a Provari   The drip mods mechs look too confusing to me *well written post switched 20 years smoking research thought way ahead beginners getting halo triton starter kit started looking realize could done better however started would able wrap head around box looking mod like mvp 2 maintenance variation maintenance tanks etc quite confusing juice cracks plastic tanks know know change coils things confusing novices almost much info possible still sure upgrade know id like better product mvp 2 provari drip mods mechs look confusing

3569*If you do get that urge and youre vaping with a low voltage setting  just knock it up a notch  The bite at the back of your throat should satisfy it   Also  sometimes you just crave the flavour of a real cigarette  Most of the tobacco flavours Ive tried tend to be pretty weak  so Ive gravitated more towards the cigar end of the spectrum just to find something that gets close  However  for me at least  its been enough to keep me off the cancer sticks  I sometimes also treat myself to a disposable electronic cigar just to have a change   Keep up the good work and ignore the naysayers in the smoking area *get urge youre low voltage setting knock notch bite back throat satisfy also sometimes crave flavour real cigarette tobacco flavours ive tried tend pretty weak ive gravitated towards cigar end spectrum find something gets close however least enough keep cancer sticks sometimes also treat disposable electronic cigar change keep good work ignore naysayers smoking area

3586*Yeah  this topic did really well in  r electronic_cigarette   The horse has already gotten out of the barn with the term e cigarettes   Changing or dropping that term would be impossible at this point and would make practically no difference   In fact  I say it would actually make things worse because it would be construed to say that the vaping community is trying to mislead the public   I dont care for the term e cig  and I purposely choose not to use it when I talk about my vaping hobby with friends   I dont use e cigs  I use a  mod  or  personal vaporizer  or whatever term makes the most sense to whoever Im talking to    The  stigma  really has nothing to do with the name   The stigma results from 20 years of regulatory and public obsession with destroying the tobacco industry   Vaping  unfortunately  is inextricably linked with tobacco because of the nicotine *yeah topic really well r electronic_cigarette horse already gotten barn term e cigarettes changing dropping term would impossible point would make practically difference fact say would actually make things worse would construed say community trying mislead public dont care term e cig purposely choose use talk hobby friends dont use e cigs use mod personal vaporizer whatever term makes sense whoever im talking stigma really nothing name stigma results 20 years regulatory public obsession destroying tobacco industry unfortunately inextricably linked tobacco nicotine

3670*Regarding the fasttech innokin debate    Read Innokins statements very clearly  they can only assume because they do not have Fasttech listed as a customer that has ordered    its highly unlikely that fasttech is ordering from Innokin AS Fasttech  Theres a very good chance that Fasttech is actually selling Innokin products  based on some of my personal research the prices theyre charging match up with their pricing model and what they most likely paid for the Innokin products on their site    Innokin  price fixes  so do a LOT of the other big names  Guess who else does  The majority of the US manufacturers of products    guess why  So the business stays healthy  Its not price fixing  its MSRP and it protects the market    When the MSRP mark up is too high or too low I take offense as a vendor and as a consumer  Innokins is one of the less offensive price models Ive run into    Fasttech is why suppliers have an MSRP  with fasttechs business model  no other store out there could possibly keep up and it would drive profit margins down to a point that for some one like me to sell those products to you  I would have to lose money on transactions    People get uppity about 100 or 120% mark ups on chinese products because they get on alibaba and find out how much that ego twist costs per unit    Lets create a fake item with a round number  Ill call it an Bog  The bog costs me 10 bucks    1  I have to buy 100 of them so I have to invest at least 1000 dollars into the product  Sounds round but at the end of the day  every dollar sitting on a shelf is a dollar not making me more money somewhere else  Same as a dollar sitting in a checking account  So a 1000 stock investment is 1000 dollars sitting flat    2  I have to pay shipping to get Bogs from china  because of long lead times and product cycles I need to ship fast  I cant afford to wait on the cheap shipping  That means Im going to pay between 5% total cost and 15% total cost of the inventory to ship  more withs ome products because batteries are heavy  p Im being very nice in my estimate there  So 1000 dollar order turned into a 1150 order   3  Ive gotta get money over there   they only take paypal or wire transfer  At a 1000 dollar cost Im looking at about 40 bucks   rounding down  with either method of payment so now were up to 1190 to get 100 Bogs to my door which puts the cost of the Bog to me at 11 9     Now  You saw 10 bucks on Alibaba for Bogs and Im already paying 11 90 so Im already almost 20% over the cost you saw  Those that run or participate in Co ops are familiar with this amount of fluff being added     but now lets look at just the costs associated with me selling YOU that bog     So Ive got a 10 dollar unit that already cost me 11 90 to get into my shop and now i have to determine what Im going to charge for it  what my mark up will be  Ill go with an easy 100%  I personally have a formula I use for different product types based on how much complexity is involved  whether or not its consumable  and whether or not its likely to need to be replaced due to failure     So Im up to 23 80 for the item YOU saw on Alibaba for 10 bucks    When I sell you that 23 80 item I will pay approximately 1 50 to my CC process bank whatever just to take your money for me and give it to me  So that brings us down to 22 30  I will spend between 1 and 1 5 on shipping materials  labels  ink  paper  etc which takes us down to about 20 8    Now we remove the cost of the item to me itself  which was 11 9 and youve got 8 9  Lets assume there was absolutely NO other costs associated with running my business for a second  I take that 8 9 and stick it in my bank account    oops  uncle sam has to get his cut too which is  30% for me so that leaves me with around 6 23 in the bank after selling an item marked up 100% I end up with around 50% of the initial cost of the item in my bank account    And guess what    those arent even close to the total sum of costs that I have to pay  those are just some of the single transaction related costs     Businesses whove been around a while or who have done their research and math before hand know that the mark up might seem huge but the take on it is a lot smaller  Consumers    they rarely understand this and will say things like  Well  how does fasttech get their prices so low then  you shoudl just drop down to compete    They get their prices down by ordering massive quantities and negotiating a lower price  they dont pay huge shipping costs to get from china to the US  they ship slow and cheap and lie on customs forms   they dont have to deal with processing fees   you pay those processing fees  The overhead for doing what they do is much lower  Innokin could sell the MVPs one at a time to you  the consumer    but they support the business model of being a supplier and not a vendor so they sell to vendors for resale and put an MSRP on there that makes sense    Some suppliers have stupid MSRPs that are too high  innokin is not one of them  *regarding fasttech innokin debate read innokins statements clearly assume fasttech listed customer ordered highly unlikely fasttech ordering innokin fasttech theres good chance fasttech actually selling innokin products based personal research prices theyre charging match pricing model likely paid innokin products site innokin price fixes lot big names guess else majority us manufacturers products guess business stays healthy price fixing msrp protects market msrp mark high low take offense vendor consumer innokins one less offensive price models ive run fasttech suppliers msrp fasttechs business model store could possibly keep would drive profit margins point one like sell products would lose money transactions people get uppity 100 120 % mark ups chinese products get alibaba find much ego twist costs per unit lets create fake item round number ill call bog bog costs 10 bucks 1 buy 100 invest least 1000 dollars product sounds round end day

3671*Ive been PMed multiple times to weigh in on the Vaporjoes part and how I feel about what he does for the community    here are my thoughts  Hes popular  he runs a rather large organization of vapers  and he posts deals  Beyond that  I dont care  Hes a beneficial force for the consumer  if he makes a lil money on it    I dont care  The  is he lieing  or whatever    I also dont care  He doesnt try to sell products  he posts deals for what they are  low priced deals  If he was pushing specific things because he makes money on them as opposed to actually posting the best deals he can find  I would start to take offense    In my experience  hes not doing that  He did defend fast tech and sorta bash innokin and that might have had a little self interest in there  but in his defense  nothing he said was  untrue  to my knowledge and fasttech  while a bane to my personal existance  is basically the walmart of chinese vaporizers right now and thats not  bad  for the consumer yet    The jury is out on whether or not it will prove to be bad in the long run  Its deffinitely bad for mom and pop shops like myself and the majority of other ecig vendors in the US  Hopefully this whole thing lights a fire under the collective asses of the US market to get out there and start making some high quality US made alternatives to the chinese stuff   *ive pmed multiple times weigh vaporjoes part feel community thoughts hes popular runs rather large organization vapers posts deals beyond dont care hes beneficial force consumer makes lil money dont care lieing whatever also dont care doesnt try sell products posts deals low priced deals pushing specific things makes money opposed actually posting best deals find would start take offense experience hes defend fast tech sorta bash innokin might little self interest defense nothing said untrue knowledge fasttech bane personal existance basically walmart chinese vaporizers right thats bad consumer yet jury whether prove bad long run deffinitely bad mom pop shops like majority vendors us hopefully whole thing lights fire collective asses us market get start making high quality us made alternatives chinese stuff
3672*This has all been explained before   Vaporjoe gets money from EVERY link from his blog  not just FastTech   The person who received the laser pointer is ONE person not getting an MVP  which was what they ordered    Thirdly  it has been explained before on this forum that FastTech most likely has a front company that buys MVPs from Innokin so they can sell them on their site for a small profit  instead of a huge profit   Yes  the MVPs from FastTech are genuine  and so are the SVDs   Innokins statement that FastTech is selling fakes is just to make people afraid to buy them *explained vaporjoe gets money every link blog fasttech person received laser pointer one person getting mvp ordered thirdly explained forum fasttech likely front company buys mvps innokin sell site small profit instead huge profit yes mvps fasttech genuine svds innokins statement fasttech selling fakes make people afraid buy
3673*This is gonna sound snotty but I dont mean for it to be  Have you actually ordered anything from fasttech  The panasonics cgr chs are the best batteries Ive used so far    no issues whatsover  I havent had an issue with any of the other products either  I know that guy got a laser but from what I understand it was just a mistake on their part and are refunding exchanging it     Im curious as to whether or not any other people have gotten any of the innokin products from them *gonna sound snotty dont mean actually ordered anything fasttech panasonics cgr chs best batteries ive used far issues whatsover havent issue products either know guy got laser understand mistake part refunding exchanging im curious whether people gotten innokin products
3674*I understand and agree with the stuff about vaporjoe   I agree that he should be able to monetize  but I do not like dishonesty manipulation   But all this Innokin stuff is just a lot of he said she said speculation   Obviously fasttech  could  be selling knockoff MVPs   Obviously fasttech  could  be buying under a different name and selling actual Innokin made MVPs   Obviously Innokin wants you to think fasttechs MVPs are knockoffs because they dont want you to buy them   Obviously fasttech wants you to think their MVPs are made by Innokin because they do want you to buy them   Surely there is someone out there that has an MVP from an authorized dealer and an MVP from fasttech that can disassemble them and see whether theyre knockoffs or not   If not  and we really want to know the truth and end all this speculative arguing  we could organize a group pool and a respected  knowledgeable  neutral member of our community could then use the pool to order one MVP from an authorized dealer  one from fasttech  and compare    r themonkeysbeard maybe   A few dollars each from 20 50 people and well know for sure   Ill throw in  10   Edit     My opinion is that I like doing business with people who are honest  Im curious  Evil_This   If it turns out fasttechs MVPs are actually Innokin made  would you stop doing business with no longer respect Innokin for leading everyone to believe that fasttechs MVPs are fake  *understand agree stuff vaporjoe agree able monetize like dishonesty manipulation innokin stuff lot said said speculation obviously fasttech could selling knockoff mvps obviously fasttech could buying different name selling actual innokin made mvps obviously innokin wants think fasttechs mvps knockoffs dont want buy obviously fasttech wants think mvps made innokin want buy surely someone mvp authorized dealer mvp fasttech disassemble see whether theyre knockoffs really want know truth end speculative arguing could organize group pool respected knowledgeable neutral member community could use pool order one mvp authorized dealer one fasttech compare r themonkeysbeard maybe dollars 20 50 people well know sure ill throw 10 edit opinion like business people honest im curious evil_this turns fasttechs mvps actually innokin made would stop business longer respect innokin leading everyone believe fasttechs mvps fake
3675*I might check vaporjoe site once in a while but  I have him as  ignored  here on reddit  I get sick of seeing spam for a site that someone makes money from   I mean shit  I dont go into  r art and post every single page from my blog  talking about the shit I have for sale  It gets tiring to see how many posts he makes   This is my personal feeling about it  Like I said  I might look at his site  but I get tired of seeing constant spam here so I have him ignored *might check vaporjoe site ignored reddit get sick seeing spam site someone makes money mean shit dont go r art post every single page blog talking shit sale gets tiring see many posts makes personal feeling like said might look site get tired seeing constant spam ignored
3676*Of course hes making money off affiliate links and affiliate coupons  I dont see a problem with it  It is also kinda shitty he wont admit to it  I see a problem with that    FastTech sells things for dirt cheap  Ive gotten a lot of garbage off there and a lot of useful items like chargers and mods  People line up in droves for coops selling knockoff mods and they can be a PITA  I like FastTech  their site doesnt look like shit and they ship quickly  A lot of the terribly run vendors stateside are throwing a fit about their profits but I dont care  Ill go wherever is cheapest    I bought a FastTech MVP for my dad  it works perfectly fine  I also bought some Vivi Novas off FastTech and they were shit  FastTech actually refunded my money and told me to keep them  Never had service like that stateside aside from a few juice vendors  *course hes making money affiliate links affiliate coupons dont see problem also kinda shitty wont admit see problem fasttech sells things dirt cheap ive gotten lot garbage lot useful items like chargers mods people line droves coops selling knockoff mods pita like fasttech site doesnt look like shit ship quickly lot terribly run vendors stateside throwing fit profits dont care ill go wherever cheapest bought fasttech mvp dad works perfectly fine also bought vivi novas fasttech shit fasttech actually refunded money told keep never service like stateside aside juice vendors
3678*I have posted my opinions on fasttech before  but on the vapor joes issue  not disclosing that if he gets kickbacks  or even that he uses affiliate links  is illegal  Sadly  Im on my phone so I cant really link the ftc info about that *posted opinions fasttech vapor joes issue disclosing gets kickbacks even uses affiliate links illegal sadly im phone cant really link ftc info
3680*I have the MVP from Fasttech  there is no doubt in my mind or other members of a forum I am on that these are 100% genuine  The quality is just that good  Fasttech take their own pics  which are excellent  The SVD  which I have  is in my opinion 100% genuine  To produce a copy that good would cost more than to buy from Innokin themselves  Innokin are putting out misinformation  I would suggest to you that before you make claims and accusations that you actually buy one from Fasttech  then you will be qualified to say these are fakes or not  but if you dont like Innokin products  dont bother  THEY ARE 100% GENUINE  Vaporjoe makes money          well surprise surprise  why the hell shouldnt he  He saves vapers the world over a lot of money  INNOKIN havent actually lied  they have made points about fake products AND selling way below the RRP  Fastech come into the latter catagory  Joyetech do exactly the same thing with their  name and shame  list and imply the cheaper sellers are selling fakes  *mvp fasttech doubt mind members forum 100 % genuine quality good fasttech take pics excellent svd opinion 100 % genuine produce copy good would cost buy innokin innokin putting misinformation would suggest make claims accusations actually buy one fasttech qualified say fakes dont like innokin products dont bother 100 % genuine vaporjoe makes money well surprise surprise hell shouldnt saves vapers world lot money innokin havent actually lied made points fake products selling way rrp fastech come latter catagory joyetech exactly thing name shame list imply cheaper sellers selling fakes
3681*Here is something I found in the Fasttech forum  VaporJoe used these coupon codes in his blog at the exact same time that he stated that he did not make money or was an affiliate   The earliest search result I found for CPASTE13SPRING was dated 13th February 2013   geek Staff JoinedJun 2012 Posts 898 Reviews 19 Kudos93 1 kudos received details The TENOFF code was initially announced in an affiliate newsletter  and later it appeared on some   forums and affiliate banners   It was scheduled to be expired in March  2013 but it stayed valid for almost 2 extra months    Coupons are usually allowed to run overtime  a grace period  to give last minute customers enough   time to make up their minds and complete the checkout process  Two months grace may be an   overkill for this purpose though   The CPASTE13SPRING coupon is also an affiliate coupon that was created in partnership with an   affiliate  It is meant for the  spring  season only and thus it is also running in grace period   now   Well update here when an exact expiry date is set for the CPASTE13SPRING code   Thank you *something found fasttech forum vaporjoe used coupon codes blog exact time stated make money affiliate earliest search result found cpaste 13spring dated 13th february 2013 geek staff joinedjun 2012 posts 898 reviews 19 kudos 93 1 kudos received details tenoff code initially announced affiliate newsletter later appeared forums affiliate banners scheduled expired march 2013 stayed valid almost 2 extra months coupons usually allowed run overtime grace period give last minute customers enough time make minds complete checkout process two months grace may overkill purpose though cpaste 13spring coupon also affiliate coupon created partnership affiliate meant spring season thus also running grace period well update exact expiry date set cpaste 13spring code thank
3682*I always assumed Vaperjoe was for profit  as long as he is honestly posting the best deal he can find  get  Im not worried  But if he doesnt post something to make money or posts a bad deal  for money  then he should thrown under the bus  *always assumed vaperjoe profit long honestly posting best deal find get im worried doesnt post something make money posts bad deal money thrown bus

3725*Agreed  hard  on the Apple Bourbon Tobacco and the Black Pom   I was only lukewarm on Black Pom the first time I got it  So when it showed up as a freebie in a later order I just kind of shrugged and threw it in the back of my juice bin for a rainy day  A few weeks later  I tried it  and holy FUCK  Just like you described   nubile  So very  very juicy  without being cloying  And  like many of Chefs juices   it just tastes  true     ABT is my hoarding juice  though  So delicious and sexy *agreed hard apple bourbon tobacco black pom lukewarm black pom first time got showed freebie later order kind shrugged threw back juice bin rainy day weeks later tried holy fuck like described nubile juicy without cloying like many chefs juices tastes true abt hoarding juice though delicious sexy

3736*Well as a pharmacist  I am acutely aware of the actions of nicotine as well as the ineffectiveness of the cessation aids  There are positive benefits ascribed to nicotine and while being described as one of the most addictive substances to man  it is almost impossible to show any inclination to self administer by laboratory animal models  I also am well aware of the actions the FDA has taken in the past and they seem to be rather aloof when presented with facts by MDs  Drug Companies  patients  pharmacists and the general population  I have personally taken action to secure adequate supplies of gear  should any unfavorablel decision transpire  At least  I know the prices will not get any lower  In the worst possible case scenario  the FDA could drive this industry underground  but I feel the momentum cannot be stopped  The answer is coming soon  The FDA are known badasses  Im ready to grown my own tobacco and extract my own nicotine if neccesary *well pharmacist acutely aware actions nicotine well ineffectiveness cessation aids positive benefits ascribed nicotine described one addictive substances man almost impossible show inclination self administer laboratory animal models also well aware actions fda taken past seem rather aloof presented facts mds drug companies patients pharmacists general population personally taken action secure adequate supplies gear unfavorablel decision transpire least know prices get lower worst possible case scenario fda could drive industry underground feel momentum cannot stopped answer coming soon fda known badasses im ready grown tobacco extract nicotine neccesary
3737*I disagree with the premise of the article  this idea that e cig bans exist for the benefit of big tobacco  The thing that struck me during the big California debate on e cig regulation  the first state to regulate them iirc   the argument for regulation basically boiled down to  its a tobacco product and therefor we need to regulate it   The question about whether it is the governments job to regulate these products in the first place is entirely lost on these people  Its about control  pure and simple  *disagree premise article idea e cig bans exist benefit big tobacco thing struck big california debate e cig regulation first state regulate iirc argument regulation basically boiled tobacco product therefor need regulate question whether governments job regulate products first place entirely lost people control pure simple
3739*Big tobacco rules the industry  Paying the industry to market vapes as just as harmful when it has been proved time and time again that it is healthier and a great method to quitting smoking  Money rules the world  Its a shame but we have to take the fight to them  A smoke free 2030 is coming *big tobacco rules industry paying industry market vapes harmful proved time time healthier great method quitting smoking money rules world shame take fight smoke free 2030 coming

3799*I had the exact same thing happen in July  Keep vaping  Its not  nearly  as tough as quitting cold turkey  just have to remember youre still getting the nicotine with vaping  which is the part your brain wants  The zippo lighter  the ashing  the particular way you snuff a cigarette when youre done  all of those things are preferences that break like very tiny twigs and you wont miss them  Especially wont miss running outside in the cold rain to get a nic fix  hopefully this part lasts    The number one thing that got me switching to vaping is that I didnt know how long to vape  I was so used to knowing how long it took to smoke a cigarette that my brain tried to reason it out the same way  So  the most helpful advice I could ever give you is that in no way or form should you compare vaping to smoking  You can vape all you want  dont try to make it  session based  like analogs   Keep going though  you wont regret it *exact thing happen july keep nearly tough quitting cold turkey remember youre still getting nicotine part brain wants zippo lighter ashing particular way snuff cigarette youre done things preferences break like tiny twigs wont miss especially wont miss running outside cold rain get nic fix hopefully part lasts number one thing got switching didnt know long used knowing long took smoke cigarette brain tried reason way helpful advice could ever give way form compare smoking want dont try make session based like analogs keep going though wont regret
3800*Cool     now  just keep vaping   As I tried different flavors  I found myself vaping more and going out for cigarettes far less   My brother in law and I would frequently chat outside when we would both go for cigarettes at the same time  I lived next door to my sister and her husband for a while and he and I both worked from home   and after a while  he thought that I had moved out because I was never outside smoking anymore   Then  one day while hanging out at a friends bar  I realized that I greatly preferred vaping   Its a process  and that was just my experience  but keep it up *cool keep tried different flavors found going cigarettes far less brother law would frequently chat outside would go cigarettes time lived next door sister husband worked home thought moved never outside smoking anymore one day hanging friends bar realized greatly preferred process experience keep

3813*But it was funded by a group that promotes alternatives to smoking  That amount of bias alone is enough to make this article completely invalid  I really want e cigs to be acceptable in the publics eyes  but this cant get any traction if the only people funding research are the people for it  and against it  There are politics in science  too    I just saw a Cosmos episode the other day that talked a bit about how the petroleum industry hired a scientist to do research to prove that lead based gasoline and paint was harmless  but that got debunked so hard  people scoff at the idea in modern society    Not saying e cigs are bad  I believe that they are perfectly fine  but biased research is going to do absolutely nothing but make us look like buffoons as we wave it around in other peoples faces  We need a neutral party that has nothing to gain or lose from this research to conduct a study  otherwise we are pretty much putting down our parents as references on job resumes  You get me  *funded group promotes alternatives smoking amount bias alone enough make article completely invalid really want e cigs acceptable publics eyes cant get traction people funding research people politics science saw cosmos episode day talked bit petroleum industry hired scientist research prove lead based gasoline paint harmless got debunked hard people scoff idea modern society saying e cigs bad believe perfectly fine biased research going absolutely nothing make us look like buffoons wave around peoples faces need neutral party nothing gain lose research conduct study otherwise pretty much putting parents references job resumes get

3915*I think the fact that it is so much less harmful than cigarettes  and helps people kick smoking  is the really important thing here  It is so well known that  smoking will kill you   I get frustrated that people are attacking e cigarettes  Maybe we dont have the library of literature behind vaping like we do with cigarette smoke  but it is like saying smoking pot is a bad alternative to shooting yourself in the head  We dont know  everything  bad about pot  but for fucks sake its probably better than a bullet to the head   I feel much better about smoking e cigarettes than newports  and my lungs feel the same way ever morning I wake up and I can BREATH  I have a feeling there is some serious tobacco industry influence going on  Thanks for your post  god bless DeawthsMeow *think fact much less harmful cigarettes helps people kick smoking really important thing well known smoking kill get frustrated people attacking e cigarettes maybe dont library literature behind like cigarette smoke like saying smoking pot bad alternative shooting head dont know everything bad pot fucks sake probably better bullet head feel much better smoking e cigarettes newports lungs feel way ever morning wake breath feeling serious tobacco industry influence going thanks post god bless deawthsmeow

4021*Yep  Just another fanboy checking in  Vapor Chef has never disappointed me in any way  Their products and their service are both outstanding    Another thing to consider is the issue of trust  Every time I see one of those news articles that uses the phrase   Its the Wild West out there in terms of juice production     which gets said way too much in my opinion   I think to myself   no  no  its not  Im buying my juice from a professional operation that takes pride in manufacturing a safe  consistent product to the requested specifications  The Chef has posted pics of his set up  and its better organized and cleaner than the kitchens of most places you eat at everyday  Also I know he and his crew are sending me the same product that they use themselves  Im comfortable vaping their juice in a way that I wasnt when I ordered from some other vendors   They are also working hard at the political level to fight against the pending regulations  and I think thats worthy of supporting *yep another fanboy checking vapor chef never disappointed way products service outstanding another thing consider issue trust every time see one news articles uses phrase wild west terms juice production gets said way much opinion think im buying juice professional operation takes pride manufacturing safe consistent product requested specifications chef posted pics set better organized cleaner kitchens places eat everyday also know crew sending product use im comfortable juice way wasnt ordered vendors also working hard political level fight pending regulations think thats worthy supporting

4060*Rock on   Just remember a few things   1  Vaping doesnt taste like smoking   Nothing tastes exactly like smoking   Thats disappointing to some people initially  but after a short while  youll be glad it doesnt   Smoke tastes horrible  and vaping tastes like whatever you want it to   If youre not fully committed to vaping after the first few drags  keep it up   Dont try to replicate the taste of your smoke    try to replace it with something MUCH better     2  If you gotta have a smoke  go for it   Dont beat yourself up over it   When I started vaping  I cut back from a pack a day to 5 or so a week  usually when drinking   but kept telling myself  This cigarette isnt a failure  its just one cigarette   No big deal   I smoked 20 a day  I can have 1 or 3 and Im still ahead of where I was  and in the future Ill smoke less    This isnt the best plan  but its better than the old plan where I picked up a cig and instantly thought  well  I failed   back to smoking      3  HYDRATE   Drink plenty of water   Cigarettes will dehydrate you a bit  and you should already have been drinking water  but vaping dehydrates you more   Make sure you drink plenty of liquids  or preferably straight up water if possible    Not sure if its necessary  but hey  thats my contribution   Hope Im helping   *rock remember things 1 doesnt taste like smoking nothing tastes exactly like smoking thats disappointing people initially short youll glad doesnt smoke tastes horrible tastes like whatever want youre fully committed first drags keep dont try replicate taste smoke try replace something much better 2 gotta smoke go dont beat started cut back pack day 5 week usually drinking kept telling cigarette isnt failure one cigarette big deal smoked 20 day 1 3 im still ahead future ill smoke less isnt best plan better old plan picked cig instantly thought well failed back smoking 3 hydrate drink plenty water cigarettes dehydrate bit already drinking water dehydrates make sure drink plenty liquids preferably straight water possible sure necessary hey thats contribution hope im helping

4121*Good beginner setup  I would suggest upgrading to a tank thats glass rather than plastic though at some point in the future*good beginner setup would suggest upgrading tank thats glass rather plastic though point future
4122*My suggestion for slight upgrades would be to jump to the iClear 16 clearomizer   5  6    Its nearly the same as the CE4  other CE4s    but it has twice as many wicks as most others   Also  you may want to switch to the eGo C Twist battery   25 for a 650    it has more circuit protection  plus variable voltage so you can get your vape just right    Edit  for clarification*suggestion slight upgrades would jump iclear 16 clearomizer 5 6 nearly ce4 ce4s twice many wicks others also may want switch ego c twist battery 25 650 circuit protection plus variable voltage get right edit clarification

4125*Second the protank mini  or possibly an Evod  both Kanger   But in general   You did miles better than any cig a like stick   Getting an actual battery and tank setup was your first WIN   If you are serious about quitting  or just starting a new hobby  This was a great choice to keep you doing it   When you are ready to upgrade  Id look at the Innoken batteries   my MVP2 is serving all my needs beyond expectation and my Protank2 mini is more than good enough  though Im thinking Protank3 soon to try dual coils   Enjoy   Im so happy to see people able to find and buy this stuff correctly   I used to have to write down all the parts for them to look for on specific websites   Im not an Evangelist or anything  but Im happy to help and your post made me happy that word is getting out about the proper way to Vape *second protank mini possibly evod kanger general miles better cig like stick getting actual battery tank setup first win serious quitting starting new hobby great choice keep ready upgrade id look innoken batteries mvp 2 serving needs beyond expectation protank 2 mini good enough though im thinking protank 3 soon try dual coils enjoy im happy see people able find buy stuff correctly used write parts look specific websites im evangelist anything im happy help post made happy word getting proper way
4126*Leagues better than what I started with   I started with a KR808d1 cigsize  with 3 0ohm off brand cartos   Im personally not a fan of Protanks or clearomizers in general  but if it works for you  no sense in fixing what isnt broken *leagues better started started KR808d1 cigsize 3 0ohm brand cartos im personally fan protanks clearomizers general works sense fixing isnt broken
4127*all matchey matchey and shit  looks nice  youll be upgrading soon though  lots of us start out on beginner vapes like that  and most of us upgrade to a mod that you can drop batteries into *matchey matchey shit looks nice youll upgrading soon though lots us start beginner vapes like us upgrade mod drop batteries
4129*So this is my setup    Im fairly new and I know you guys have big wonderful mod  but what do you think about this for a new starter    Also I was wondering  how often do I need or should clean up the tank  And do I have to buy new ones like this one pretty often or can I keep it    Thanks and happy vaping  *setup im fairly new know guys big wonderful mod think new starter also wondering often need clean tank buy new ones like one pretty often keep thanks happy
4130*This is the only set up youll really ever need   If you do decide to move on to a mod  keep this thing handy as a reliable back up   As for the burnt taste  make sure the wick gets thoroughly soaked with juice before using it   I usually just let it sit exactly like your picture with a full tank for about 10 minutes   Looks like a twist  so make sure you start out with a lower setting  like a 3 8   Mine usually vaps best around 4 0  but this will vary depending upon the juice   If you still have a burnt taste  try replacing the atomizer inside  let the wick soak  and try again   Good luck *set youll really ever need decide move mod keep thing handy reliable back burnt taste make sure wick gets thoroughly soaked juice using usually let sit exactly like picture full tank 10 minutes looks like twist make sure start lower setting like 3 8 mine usually vaps best around 4 0 vary depending upon juice still burnt taste try replacing atomizer inside let wick soak try good luck

4133*it looks great  what flavors have you tried  I like vanilla and mixed fruit  myself  Ive tried pineapple and it was good too  *looks great flavors tried like vanilla mixed fruit ive tried pineapple good
4134*Best advice I could give based on your setup would be to remove the silica wicks from the coil and replace them with cotton  you can use a cotton ball   just tear a small bit off  roll it up  put it in  and trim it   Immediate flavor enhancement *best advice could give based setup would remove silica wicks coil replace cotton use cotton ball tear small bit roll put trim immediate flavor enhancement

4332*I dont think Ive purchased a single bottle that didnt have a childproof cap   I suppose if you get the dropper in a glass bottle it would be easy to pop the top and down it though     These concerns are all valid  but should hopefully be addressed easily without overregulation   Most of the arguments they use sound like a dyhydrogenmonoxide article  Intentionally focusing on the extremes to gen up outrage   Why cant anyone have an honest discussion about e liquid and e cigarettes instead of sensationalizing it   You cant reason someone out of an opinion they didnt reason themselves into    Wont somebody  please  think of the children   *dont think ive purchased single bottle didnt childproof cap suppose get dropper glass bottle would easy pop top though concerns valid hopefully addressed easily without overregulation arguments use sound like dyhydrogenmonoxide article intentionally focusing extremes gen outrage cant anyone honest discussion e liquid e cigarettes instead sensationalizing cant reason someone opinion didnt reason wont somebody please think children
4333*At the end of the article  he states that some liquids can be ordered on the internet with 2 4 percent nicotine or even 10 percent nicotine present in it  Thats true  but only true for liquid nicotine solutions  The ten percent presence is what you get with buying 100mg Nicotine solution  which I use to make e liquids with  Once that is diluted into the e liquid  for one of my 16mg juices  we are looking at a total of 0 48% actual nicotine in the overall product  So     that claim was grossly taken out of context  He states these percentages in close relation to the end product  e liquid  Which is blatantly false  But at the same time  he doesnt state that that is what is present in e lquids  Dirty journalism  The actual percentages in the end product are not enough to cause fatality  unless taken in very very high doses  And I dont know about anyone else  but my nicotine solution is no where near the reach of children  Also  it doesnt smell good  it tastes horrible  and the bottle it comes in is about as appealing to a kid as drinking cleaning solvent  Actually  less appealing  considering that cleaning solvents are usually labeled with colors  *end article states liquids ordered internet 2 4 percent nicotine even 10 percent nicotine present thats true true liquid nicotine solutions ten percent presence get buying 100mg nicotine solution use make e liquids diluted e liquid one 16mg juices looking total 0 48 % actual nicotine overall product claim grossly taken context states percentages close relation end product e liquid blatantly false time doesnt state present e lquids dirty journalism actual percentages end product enough cause fatality unless taken high doses dont know anyone else nicotine solution near reach children also doesnt smell good tastes horrible bottle comes appealing kid drinking cleaning solvent actually less appealing considering cleaning solvents usually labeled colors
4334*So     People are stupid  We already knew nicotine is toxic    Its alarmist  but not necessarily unwarranted  People being stupid is the root cause here  *people stupid already knew nicotine toxic alarmist necessarily unwarranted people stupid root cause
4335* Matt Richtel is an American writer and journalist for The New York Times  He was awarded the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for a series on distracted driving   He gets paid to write sensationalized stories for the sake of journalism  Hes a media troll striking a nerve on both sides of the debate while inciting outsiders to join in   Ermagard  the sky falling      *matt richtel american writer journalist new york times awarded 2010 pulitzer prize national reporting series distracted driving gets paid write sensationalized stories sake journalism hes media troll striking nerve sides debate inciting outsiders join ermagard sky falling

4390*I am just a bit stumped as to why you would do a co op on such a low priced mod  I am not referring to the FastTech price  but on other sites  the E Pipe is cheap enough for me to not even consider co ops  Now  something thats  100 and over  hard to get  and needs to be bought in bulk to get it here  Sure  That sounds reasonable  A mod I could buy after a couple hours of work  Dont see the point in going through the hassle of a co op  It cant bring the price down  that  much  *bit stumped would co op low priced mod referring fasttech price sites e pipe cheap enough even consider co ops something thats 100 hard get needs bought bulk get sure sounds reasonable mod could buy couple hours work dont see point going hassle co op cant bring price much

4416*I quit smoking reds  Heres what worked   Get a battery mod  There are rechargeable ones such as the Innoken VW which allows you to adjust wattage to your preferred throat hit mouth feel  They range from cheap and simple where you charge via USB  or expensive and more sophisticated where they take rechargeable batteries that can be swapped   Get a tank  I prefer to switch out pre assembled atomizers and dont fuss with rebuildables  The kangertech Aerotank mega  or the aerotank mini perform well for me  Only difference between the two is the size of tank    After these costs  you need e liquid  I spend about  150 a month on fluid but by no means am I bargain shopping  I have a local shop with a particular fluid thats pricy   I consume about 5 ml a day  Thats about two tanks in my mega  so I only fill twice in a day  I have an iTaste 134  which is essentially a iTaste VW but massive and takes 18650 batteries for easy back up energy   Im rambling now so ima stop  Ask if you have questions *quit smoking reds heres worked get battery mod rechargeable ones innoken vw allows adjust wattage preferred throat hit mouth feel range cheap simple charge via usb expensive sophisticated take rechargeable batteries swapped get tank prefer switch pre assembled atomizers dont fuss rebuildables kangertech aerotank mega aerotank mini perform well difference two size tank costs need e liquid spend 150 month fluid means bargain shopping local shop particular fluid thats pricy consume 5 ml day thats two tanks mega fill twice day itaste 134 essentially itaste vw massive takes 18650 batteries easy back energy im rambling ima stop ask questions
4418*Lots of really good posts here  but I wanted to add in that once you get comfortable with the setup you initially get  consider rebuildables and making your own juice  Your initial cost will be high  but over time your TOC will be much lower  If you go full DIY mode on this stuff  you can expect about seven cents or so for a tank full of juice  or a bottle full of juice to drip  That is WAY cheaper than a pack of smokes  Best of luck to you *lots really good posts wanted add get comfortable setup initially get consider rebuildables making juice initial cost high time toc much lower go full diy mode stuff expect seven cents tank full juice bottle full juice drip way cheaper pack smokes best luck

4486*While this is for the most part ridiculous  I think that it could be applicable in a few scenarios  If you get a nice vape setup and you have quality products  you should have less worry about carcinogens and such  However  IF you get one of those shitty gas station e cigs  you are walking a line of questionability  This is true with every mass produced  cheap product  They arent going to be doing strict checks on these crappy little devices because they would lose money  Be safe fellow e cig and vape users and invest a bit of money into a quality setup  Sure  it will be more money up front  but with quality products  you can rest  more  assured that you wont run into health issues caused by negligence  For the same reason  one should not buy sushi from a gas station either *part ridiculous think could applicable scenarios get nice setup quality products less worry carcinogens however get one shitty gas station e cigs walking line questionability true every mass produced cheap product arent going strict checks crappy little devices would lose money safe fellow e cig users invest bit money quality setup sure money front quality products rest assured wont run health issues caused negligence reason one buy sushi gas station either
4488*TRUTH  Early evidence is suggesting that they are not safer than cigarettes   No scientific studies have confirmed that they are safe to use  e cigarettes do not contain tar or other chemicals associated with combustion  but the nicotine cartridges may still contain questionable amounts of carcinogens 2  So no evidence means that it is already bad  Lol  People are sheep *truth early evidence suggesting safer cigarettes scientific studies confirmed safe use e cigarettes contain tar chemicals associated combustion nicotine cartridges may still contain questionable amounts carcinogens 2 evidence means already bad lol people sheep

4775*I honestly think vaping should be regulated  No one under 18  Just like analogs  As for not being able to vape in public places  Im kind of annoyed by that  There is no second hand inhalants besides water vapor and odors caused by the flavoring  If I cant vape in a public area  no one should be allowed to consume hot foods or grill either  God forbid you want to have a bonfire *honestly think regulated one 18 like analogs able public places im kind annoyed second hand inhalants besides water vapor odors caused flavoring cant public area one allowed consume hot foods grill either god forbid want bonfire

4796*Coming from r all here with my own testimony   I smoked for about 20 years and tried to quit multiple times   the patch  gum  even Chex Chantix   nothing worked   Two years ago my wife convinced me to order some nicotine e cigarettes  Immediately I stopped smoking actual cigarettes  Within 6 months I was chewing gum  Now 2 years later I havent had a single cigarette since   For me  nothing worked for over two decades until I started using e cigarettes  This quite likely saved my life   just the new years before I finally switched I was having an enormous amount of health symptoms   shortness of breath  throbbing head aches  tingling and burning sensations in my extremities  I even passed out briefly at our new years party with a bout of light headedness    Now  it almost goes without saying  but since making the switch all of those symptoms have disappeared  Not only that but my health has made a huge rebound   Ive lost weight since then and Ive been able to go to the gym and work out  which was impossible before with my wheezing and gasping and massive blood pressure problems    Its impossible for me to overstate this   I am so incredibly thankful that my wife convinced me to give e cigarettes a try  I dont even want to imagine what would have happened to me if I hadnt made the switch and I heartily recommend it to anyone reading this thread and wishing that they could quit smoking but had failed multiple times like I did  You literally have nothing to lose and perhaps your entire life to gain  *coming r testimony smoked 20 years tried quit multiple times patch gum even chex chantix nothing worked two years ago wife convinced order nicotine e cigarettes immediately stopped smoking actual cigarettes within 6 months chewing gum 2 years later havent single cigarette since nothing worked two decades started using e cigarettes quite likely saved life new years finally switched enormous amount health symptoms shortness breath throbbing head aches tingling burning sensations extremities even passed briefly new years party bout light headedness almost goes without saying since making switch symptoms disappeared health made huge rebound ive lost weight since ive able go gym work impossible wheezing gasping massive blood pressure problems impossible overstate incredibly thankful wife convinced give e cigarettes try dont even want imagine would happened hadnt made switch heartily recommend anyone reading thread wishing could quit smoking failed multiple times like literally nothing lose perhaps entire life gain

4800*Just turned 40  smoked for 20 years  Its been two years since Ive had a cigarette  all thanks to vaping  I dont go to vape shops and I dont preach about it  but I will say that it works  First couple weeks are pretty tough  and I still think about smoking from time to time  but if you do anything for that long  its going to be a part of you for a very long time    Quitting smoking has never been easier  If you have a desire to quit  you CAN do it  This tastes better  smells better  and you will start to feel results QUICKLY  Those results will encourage you to keep going  and before you know it  youve gone weeks without a cigarette    Theres a lot of quit smoking apps out there that can help you count the days  and counting days can be important when youre quitting  I didnt stop counting days until it had been well over a year  I opened that app several times a day for weeks  I checked how much money I hadnt spent on cigarettes  how many cigarettes I hadnt smoked  what health benefits I should expect  etc  I was still thinking about cigarettes  just as I had for the previous 20 years    i just wasnt smoking them    Some people say to throw out your pack of cigarettes when you have a set up for vaping  Personally  I did not  I kept my pack of cigarettes  because i knew the kind of anxiety that not having access to cigarettes caused me  I kept my last pack  and it was in plain sight in my bedroom  It was there if I absolutely needed it  Knowing that I could have a cigarette whenever I wanted actually helped me  When that craving hit me  I huffed on that goddamn vape like a fiend  But that craving would subside after 10 minutes of vaping hard  and I would completely forget about the cigarette  I tried one cigarette after a month of not having any   my cravings for them had subsided  I just wanted to see what I would think of them at that point  It was terrible  and I didnt finish it  I took a couple drags and put it out  It tasted bad  felt bad  and smelled bad  At that point  I knew I had won   When you first start  you might not know how long to vape in one go because it doesnt have the predestined time that a lit cigarette does  Dont be worried that you dont know when to stop  Just keep going until you feel like youve had enough  Vape for an hour straight if you are having cravings  Just keep going until youve had enough  Youll figure it out    So I recommend finding a vaping solution that works for YOU    and at this point  its not hard to find one  Dont worry about the people who say it looks stupid  say its for douche bags  or whatever stigmas are attached at this point  Youre doing something for your health  and you dont have to participate in any  vape culture    You can quit  and its never been easier than it is right now *turned 40 smoked 20 years two years since ive cigarette thanks dont go shops dont preach say works first couple weeks pretty tough still think smoking time time anything long going part long time quitting smoking never easier desire quit tastes better smells better start feel results quickly results encourage keep going know youve gone weeks without cigarette theres lot quit smoking apps help count days counting days important youre quitting didnt stop counting days well year opened app several times day weeks checked much money hadnt spent cigarettes many cigarettes hadnt smoked health benefits expect etc still thinking cigarettes previous 20 years wasnt smoking people say throw pack cigarettes set personally kept pack cigarettes knew kind anxiety access cigarettes caused kept last pack plain sight bedroom absolutely needed knowing could cigarette whenever wanted actually helped craving hit huffed goddamn like fiend craving would subside 10 minutes hard would completely forget cigarette tried one cigarette month cravings subsided wanted see would think point terrible didnt finish took couple drags put tasted bad felt bad smelled bad point knew first start might know long one go doesnt predestined time lit cigarette dont worried dont know stop keep going feel like youve enough hour straight cravings keep going youve enough youll figure recommend finding solution works point hard find one dont worry people say looks stupid say douche bags whatever stigmas attached point youre something health dont participate culture quit never easier right

4816*Heres an unbiased testimonial  I dont smoke  My mom has smoked 1 2 packs a day for 40 years  I got her to try a starter kit that cost around  60 70 and the refills are like half the cost of smokes if not less  We were complete newbies  the local vape shop walked us through everything  had sles for her to try of different flavors and was able to add the appropriate nicotine level for her   She was a die hard smoker before  Pleas to quit fell on deaf ears  She was steadfast   Once she tried e cigs and finished the pack of tobacco she had open  she never had another one  She even tried to return the rest of her tobacco carton to the local gas station for a refund  not sure if that worked or not  she said she was a  good customer  so probably so   She had insisted on a menthol flavor juice and plenty of nicotine  within days she was eager to explore more options and ended up with a Tutti Fruitti type flavor  when initially she said she didnt want  weird  flavors   She was a hardcore smoker for 40 years  She quit that basically cold turkey  saves a tons of money  sleeps better at night and has more energy during the day  I hate that shadow organizations advance a negative agenda on e cigs  Even IF there may be some slight health risks  it is decidedly  to me and my mom  waaaaay better than the known risks of tobacco cigarettes    One of many success stories  If you dont smoke  you can help a friend or family member get pointed in this direction *heres unbiased testimonial dont smoke mom smoked 1 2 packs day 40 years got try starter kit cost around 60 70 refills like half cost smokes less complete newbies local shop walked us everything sles try different flavors able add appropriate nicotine level die hard smoker pleas quit fell deaf ears steadfast tried e cigs finished pack tobacco open never another one even tried return rest tobacco carton local gas station refund sure worked said good customer probably insisted menthol flavor juice plenty nicotine within days eager explore options ended tutti fruitti type flavor initially said didnt want weird flavors hardcore smoker 40 years quit basically cold turkey saves tons money sleeps better night energy day hate shadow organizations advance negative agenda e cigs even may slight health risks decidedly mom waaaaay better known risks tobacco cigarettes one many success stories dont smoke help friend family member get pointed direction

4818*I am a chronic pain patient and smoked 3 packs of home rolled cigarettes a day for 29 years  That is very important to note because I didnt just smoke for nicotine  I NEEDED cigarettes because they helped to control my pain  Even still I accidentally quit smoking in June 2014 and the results have been so dramatic it is amazing  I never thought I could quit  EVER  I never even tried  I fiddled with e cigs from the very first Chinese ciga likes cicra 2007 on out until one day on a whim I went to a local shop and bought a decent midrange starter setup  think ego and aspire not evod  and within a month I was no longer a dual user  I was a vaper and an ex smoker  I feel better but do have more pain but that was coming anyhow  You dont recover from Degenerative Disc Disease and that is just one tiny problem in the grocery list of things that cause me debilitating pain   My Doctors are so on board with this switch they do not think I ever need to even lower my nicotine level   All signs of my having ever smoked are disappearing and fast  My lungs were always clear and good with no shadowing but there is some visible healing showing on my latest chest x rays  So I guess I did have some physical changes in my lungs after all  I have lowered my nicotine though  I went from 36MG in May to 18MG around October and my next round of huge purchasing will be in a few months I might drop down to 12MG at that point    I am extremely overweight due to Celiac  Allergies  Insane amounts of Steroids  Lyrica  bad genetics and emotional eating to dull the pain but I didnt gain any weight when I quit smoking  I actually lost weight because these amazing flavors help keep the part of my weight problem I can control in check  I no longer reach for things I am allergic too because I have such amazing flavors to vape like a Blueberry Custard with an awesome name like Jizmogoblin from Mt  Baker Vapor    That is also important to note  Flavors keep me from overeating  I didnt get that metabolic slow down many people experience when they quit smoking  It was actually the reverse  So amazing   My Blood Pressure was never bad enough for medication but would spike with severe pain  The last time someone smashed me in my car my BP was 180 in the ER  They were worried I was going to have a heart attack because they couldnt control my pain  I have since then been in comparable pain and my Blood Pressure never even topped out at 140  This might not be a huge change but my resting pulse dropped from 86 to 70 which is pretty amazing for a sedentary severely overweight person who can barely walk  I did nothing but switch to vaping    My hair and nails started to grow like crazy when I quit smoking too  This is also amazing because I suffer from eczema over 80% of my body including my scalp  I was losing my hair last year and now its growing despite that fact I bleach it to death every month to control the rash  My nails were so brittle from the lack of nutrients I absorb but do grow now that I quit smoking   One final note is that I need surgery  My spine in my neck is beyond recovery  My cervical spine has straightened and is now bowing in the wrong direction  One disc has tri compartmental stenosis which means the nerves are being compressed in 3 directions  I am the type of case that you hear about when someone just wakes up paralyzed  That risk is real for me  I need surgery  No doctor would touch me before because I smoked  The best case scenario is 20% fusion healing with a smoker  It goes up to almost 50% now that I quit  I need a tri level fusion and that is a hugely complicated surgery with an obviously high failure rate  I do not have the Science to prove this only the various Surgeons who fired me because I smoked  They refused to do the surgery even though they told me I have no choice but to have it  I even had a Healer Physical Therapist Chiropractor refuse to take my case because he said he didnt think he should try to help me heal when I am undoing all of it by smoking  This man said this to me five years ago  It didnt even phase me other then crying my eyes out from the pain  I just kept on smoking  I was in real danger

4831*I say no vaping in commercial buildings  At all  I say this not only because of the obvious fact that people in buildings might not appreciate vape clouds  but for the very real reason that vapor will  and does  set off commercial fire alarm systems    In the past year weve had to evacuate our entire building over a dozen times due to people vaping within close proximity to smoke detectors  These detectors are required by fire code    I run a venue which charges admission to over a million people a year  evacuating and reimbursing hundreds to thousands of people per incident is highly expensive  per occurrence   I can say  with absolute certainty  that people vaping on the premises of the venue I manage has cost our company at least  100k in 2016  and that was just at one site out of about 400 sites   Edit  clarification *say commercial buildings say obvious fact people buildings might appreciate clouds real reason vapor set commercial fire alarm systems past year weve evacuate entire building dozen times due people within close proximity smoke detectors detectors required fire code run venue charges admission million people year evacuating reimbursing hundreds thousands people per incident highly expensive per occurrence say absolute certainty people premises venue manage cost company least 100k 2016 one site 400 sites edit clarification

4863*The thing people dont understand about vaping is that not everyone chucks huge clouds that can smoke out a place  I use small  refillable e cigs and I can vape just about anywhere  No one one notices the vape because of how little the vapor I blow is  People who enjoy huge clouds should also invest in low powered devices for on the go *thing people dont understand everyone chucks huge clouds smoke place use small refillable e cigs anywhere one one notices little vapor blow people enjoy huge clouds also invest low powered devices go
4864*FWIW  this approach is not the norm in the UK   I work next to a hospital and they are clear you cannot smoke or vape anywhere on hospital grounds   they do not provide smoking areas  you must leave the grounds   You can also not vape or smoke on any trains  including the tube   or in any train stations  even ones where the platforms are outside   Most privately owned public spaces  like restaurants and shopping centres are also no vaping  and legally cannot allow smoking *fwiw approach norm uk work next hospital clear cannot smoke anywhere hospital grounds provide smoking areas must leave grounds also smoke trains including tube train stations even ones platforms outside privately owned public spaces like restaurants shopping centres also legally cannot allow smoking

4887*Both my wife and I switched to eCigs about 18 months ago  We were both pack a day smokers and she ended up in the hospital with breathing issues and was diagnosed with COPD   Switching to eCigs has saved both our lives  We are both healthier as a result and her pulmonary doctor has seen her lung function get much better to the point where the COPD is a non issue now   We started with GreenSmoke eCigs for about a year before we switched to Joyetech eGo CC with a variety of different juices   Yes  we have swapped one habit with another but eCigs are 1000 times better then cigarettes and that is the main point about switching to eCigs  Getting rid of the burning tabacco and chemicals out of the lungs makes a massive difference to both ourselves and those around us   To the anti smokers who are also anti vapers  you are all doing yourselves a disservice  your mission is to get people to stop smoking and killing themselves  By being anti vaping you are taking away one of the best ways to get people to quit smoking and be healthier   If you are thinking of giving up smoking for the new year and you have tried the patch  or gum or any other method that has not worked then try the eCig  You wont regret it  *wife switched ecigs 18 months ago pack day smokers ended hospital breathing issues diagnosed copd switching ecigs saved lives healthier result pulmonary doctor seen lung function get much better point copd non issue started greensmoke ecigs year switched joyetech ego cc variety different juices yes swapped one habit another ecigs 1000 times better cigarettes main point switching ecigs getting rid burning tabacco chemicals lungs makes massive difference around us anti smokers also anti vapers disservice mission get people stop smoking killing anti taking away one best ways get people quit smoking healthier thinking giving smoking new year tried patch gum method worked try wont regret

5065*I want to like the article but he doesnt make the point that these devices are actually used for cessation  There is no evidence that these teenagers and pre teens were addicted to cigarettes and nicotine before picking up a vape  So this is just going to be more fuel for the fire of the  baptists  as he refers to them   These devices are causing kids who would never smoke to start a nicotine habit   *want like article doesnt make point devices actually used cessation evidence teenagers pre teens addicted cigarettes nicotine picking going fuel fire baptists refers devices causing kids would never smoke start nicotine habit

5248*I feel like NO ONE ever mentions to beginners how different levels of nicotine vape  and it also differs hugely to each device  When vaping on a large RBA or RDA 18ml would wreck my throat  I vape at 3 6mg  But when using a smaller pen style device 13 18mg is fine  Also when I started vaping I kept messing around thinking my vape was too hot when I was really just too high of a nicotine content     Edit  Because it looks like I made the top post  I would like to take the chance to at least explain to any noobies a little more in depth what I wish someone told me  When I first started vaping  I wanted something that made big clouds  had a cool not too hot  vape  and enough nicotine to keep me from craving  I knew this was possible  I had used an old co workers mechmod once before and really enjoyed it  I got 26650 Mod and a big TOBH Atty  plus an ohmeterkanthal and started learning and building away  It seemed to me like no matter what I did the vape was too hot or too harsh  but if I went too high in resistance ohms  the vape just sucked  I couldnt figure out what I was doing wrong and any time I went to a B M I would say it was too hot or harsh and I wanted it cooler  theyd just say to  try a higher gauge wire  add more wraps  try new juices  Yada yada yada  It took me a good 2 3 weeks to figure out TWO very important things for myself that made me enjoy vaping oh so much more  AIRFLOW  the drip tip I had  and the drip tips I see around at most B Ms were way to small  They all may fit a 510 connection but many of them have tiny little funnels for the air to travel through causing it to restrict a lot of air  Second was nicotine level  I kept thinking my vape was too hot when really it was too harsh  There is a difference  To any newbies out there  if it seems too hot harsh to you  especially on the exhale  the likely reason is that your vaping too high of a Nic level for your setup  I found out that with my Tobh Ive tried many more RBAs and RDAs at this point and daily a Doge now  I could take HUGE mouth to lung hits  have cool vapor  no harshness  and really enjoy my vape  I had used Crappy eGo kits etc before and vaped them with 24mg nic content and it seemed like no big deal  but learning how to BALANCE airflow  coil resistance  and Nicotine levels are the most important things that lead to me enjoying vaping and being able to drop the cigarettes for good  This knowledge is just a base point  but for me is what made it worth it  You can get involved in all the different flavors  mods and atomizers out there but if you dont really learn the craft and what YOU enjoy an what works for you then you will just keep chasing something that isnt there    Best of luck to all of you  Merry Christmas and happy holidays  *feel like one ever mentions beginners different levels nicotine also differs hugely device large rba rda 18ml would wreck throat 3 6mg using smaller pen style device 13 18mg fine also started kept messing around thinking hot really high nicotine content edit looks like made top post would like take chance least explain noobies little depth wish someone told first started wanted something made big clouds cool hot enough nicotine keep craving knew possible used old co workers mechmod really enjoyed got 26650 mod big tobh atty plus ohmeterkanthal started learning building away seemed like matter hot harsh went high resistance ohms sucked couldnt figure wrong time went b would say hot harsh wanted cooler theyd say try higher gauge wire add wraps try new juices yada yada yada took good 2 3 weeks figure two important things made enjoy oh much airflow drip tip drip tips see around b ms way small may fit 510 connection many tiny little funnels air travel causing restrict lot air second nicotine level kept thinking hot really harsh difference newbies seems hot harsh especially exhale likely reason high nic level setup found tobh ive tried many rbas rdas point daily doge could take huge mouth lung hits cool vapor harshness really enjoy used crappy ego kits etc vaped 24mg nic content seemed like big deal learning balance airflow coil resistance nicotine levels important things lead enjoying able drop cigarettes good knowledge base point made worth get involved different flavors mods atomizers dont really learn craft enjoy works keep chasing something isnt best luck merry christmas happy holidays

5432*Everyone here seems to be confused by the 40% thing    The article clearly states that this number is for disposable e cigarettes  Before going on to refillables    If you really want to get that cost down  you can sacrifice some convenience and buy a reusable vape with liquid refills  getting the cost down to about  500 to  600 per year   an average savings of over  2 000    That aside  the big problem with this article is the inane and naive end comment that smokers would be better to kick it altogether  On what grounds  fuckwit  Vaping being 95% healthier than smoking makes it healthier than junk food  whats the problem  Furthermore  it completely misses the fucking point  to denigrate the most effective anti smoking aid EVER simply because its not cold turkey is fucking inane and dangerous  Its better that people quit to something virtually harmless than try for something only slightly better and never fucking get there *everyone seems confused 40 % thing article clearly states number disposable e cigarettes going refillables really want get cost sacrifice convenience buy reusable liquid refills getting cost 500 600 per year average savings 2 000 aside big problem article inane naive end comment smokers would better kick altogether grounds fuckwit 95 % healthier smoking makes healthier junk food whats problem furthermore completely misses fucking point denigrate effective anti smoking aid ever simply cold turkey fucking inane dangerous better people quit something virtually harmless try something slightly better never fucking get

5475*As a designer  my only suggestion is to keep all the lobes in the vape cloud on the horizontal plane  You appeared to have changed the orientation on a few of them so theyre at an angle  the one furthest outside is the most jarring exle    So use different sizes and shapes of ovals  but dont rotate them after  and I think youll get a bit better result   The cloud is also  slightly  more detailed than the stock logo might suggest  so you might simplify the design just a tad  slightly fewer lobes overall and thicker strokes    Otherwise its a great idea  Nice job *designer suggestion keep lobes cloud horizontal plane appeared changed orientation theyre angle one furthest outside jarring exle use different sizes shapes ovals dont rotate think youll get bit better result cloud also slightly detailed stock logo might suggest might simplify design tad slightly fewer lobes overall thicker strokes otherwise great idea nice job

5537*I am always sketched out when B Ms sell Efests and nothing else  and avidly sell them without proclaiming their  tested  ratings instead of their  labeled  ratings    I have actually shown  YOUR  results to an employee regarding battery safety  and been given the cold shoulder    It horrifies and sickens me  The same goes for battery chargers  and I have to say that we should be testing them too   I dont buy batteries locally because I never see 25Rs or similar batteries in my area  and owners are never willing to discuss proper battery safety with me  I dont buy chargers locally either because if they sell a Trustfire or similar charger  and then a reputable one  theyre automatically untrustworthy to me  I am garrulously throwing that out there  deal with it   If they sell a terrible one out of convenience when they have a better one  their reputation is degraded   Such ad hominem attacks from Efest are low blows and we shouldnt support them  The unfortunate situation regarding 18650 batteries is that because they are binned as A  B  C  and D by more legitimate companies and cherry picked by accuracy  A   the others are allowed to label them however they wish because theyre outside of US law  Theres no law inside the US that regulates these things as such  so to speak  but people like Mooch  and technologies that allow us to test them divert such accidents and mishaps involved with these lack of laws   We should include legitimate battery standards in regulations  20A minimum  minimum mAh allowances  and tested battery curve legitimacy  The same goes for battery chargers and all of their variables  I couldnt care less if anyone here doesnt like it   Your post is not an ad hominem regarding all this  Mooch  Youre calling out the bullshit  and thats highly respectable *always sketched b ms sell efests nothing else avidly sell without proclaiming tested ratings instead labeled ratings actually shown results employee regarding battery safety given cold shoulder horrifies sickens goes battery chargers say testing dont buy batteries locally never see 25rs similar batteries area owners never willing discuss proper battery safety dont buy chargers locally either sell trustfire similar charger reputable one theyre automatically untrustworthy garrulously throwing deal sell terrible one convenience better one reputation degraded ad hominem attacks efest low blows shouldnt support unfortunate situation regarding 18650 batteries binned b c legitimate companies cherry picked accuracy others allowed label however wish theyre outside us law theres law inside us regulates things speak people like mooch technologies allow us test divert accidents mishaps involved lack laws include legitimate battery standards regulations 20a minimum minimum mah allowances tested battery curve legitimacy goes battery chargers variables couldnt care less anyone doesnt like post ad hominem regarding mooch youre calling bullshit thats highly respectable

5556*I think this is one of the reasons the media is quick to condemn vaping  Big Tobacco ran a huge scam on the whole country for years  There are studies linking tobacco with cancer as early as 1956 and the evidence increased every year  Hell they started selling light cigarettes because people felt like shit when they smoked  All the while the government did nothing and the media licked boot  There are books written about how completely in the dark Big Tobacco kept everyone despite mounting evidence to the contrary    The government and media both want everyone to know theyre totally reformed and would never do anything like that again  even though they both still do   So if you can take a couple of shots at the little guy while still bedding the giants of industry  its an easy win *think one reasons media quick condemn big tobacco ran huge scam whole country years studies linking tobacco cancer early 1956 evidence increased every year hell started selling light cigarettes people felt like shit smoked government nothing media licked boot books written completely dark big tobacco kept everyone despite mounting evidence contrary government media want everyone know theyre totally reformed would never anything like even though still take couple shots little guy still bedding giants industry easy win

5709*Im confused about why you merely link to an image of a screenshot of a comment on reddit  instead  of a summary explanation about whats up    The beginning of the end sounds a bit dire  IMO there is no way to completely kill vaping  This is not flavored cigarettes  As long as PG VG base with nicotine is sold then vaping cannot die  The worst that can happen is flavors are sold separately and you mix them together at home  Yes this would suck  and yes a lot of people stores  would not be able to adapt their business model which would be sad   maybe it would kill zlebox though  a silver lining        Dont get me wrong  Im not advocating ignoring this stuff because it will still live on in a different form  We deserve to continue as it is currently  I have only seen juice vendors  except for the few scammers  but theyre far and few between  who care about their customers and post large blocks of text so that they can disclose info about what youre buying to the best of their knowledge   I bet if we go to the e cig wiki article and look up edits  all of the ones that say that it isnt proven safer than cigarettes come from tobacco grower states  or IP address blocks associated with big tobacco  They have no morals  they know damn well that inhaling vegtable glycerin or even diacetyl loaded juices will never come close to the horrible dangers of tobacco  They sell death  and now they sell uncertainity in alternatives just so their business model  get people hooked  keep them hooked until they no longer breath  rinse  repeat  remains safe   I highly applause CVS for stopping selling cigarettes  you shouldnt be able to run a pharmacy if you sell products that are inherently dangerous  If I had the lobbying power of tobacco companies I could sell bags of glass laced with mercury and Cobalt 60*im confused merely link image screenshot comment reddit instead summary explanation whats beginning end sounds bit dire imo way completely kill flavored cigarettes long pg vg base nicotine sold cannot die worst happen flavors sold separately mix together home yes would suck yes lot people stores would able adapt business model would sad maybe would kill zlebox though silver lining dont get wrong im advocating ignoring stuff still live different form deserve continue currently seen juice vendors except scammers theyre far care customers post large blocks text disclose info youre buying best knowledge bet go e cig wiki article look edits ones say isnt proven safer cigarettes come tobacco grower states ip address blocks associated big tobacco morals know damn well inhaling vegtable glycerin even diacetyl loaded juices never come close horrible dangers tobacco sell death sell uncertainity alternatives business model get people hooked keep hooked longer breath rinse repeat remains safe highly applause cvs stopping selling cigarettes shouldnt able run pharmacy sell products inherently dangerous lobbying power tobacco companies could sell bags glass laced mercury cobalt 60
5711*I find it appalling that people are still calling our gear and ejuice  tobacco products   Last I checked I stopped smoking tobacco 2 months ago    It just goes to show you how hilariously misinformed the public is  the media is  the FDA is  and our government is on the matter      It also doesnt help that literally all of the tobacco giants are old fashioned American companies  a  legacy  as some would say  I know for a fact that RJ Reynolds has at least half of the countrys congressmen and senators in their pocket too  This whole thing is fueled by mislead  untrue  bribery bullshit that weve seen time and time again in our so called  government   Enough is enough  Im tired of rights being stripped away for popularity and hard cash  *find appalling people still calling gear ejuice tobacco products last checked stopped smoking tobacco 2 months ago goes show hilariously misinformed public media fda government matter also doesnt help literally tobacco giants old fashioned american companies legacy would say know fact rj reynolds least half countrys congressmen senators pocket whole thing fueled mislead untrue bribery bullshit weve seen time time called government enough enough im tired rights stripped away popularity hard cash

6326*Even if the FDA doesnt qualify synthetic nicotine as a tobacco product the FDA still has authority to regulate it as a drug  Such as patches gum etc  *even fda doesnt qualify synthetic nicotine tobacco product fda still authority regulate drug patches gum etc
6327*They missed the dubious logic that the FDA used when publically stating their reason zero nicotine is included  Neither the FDA  nor Nicopure and other complainants brought it up in any of the briefs     A vaporizer is a tobacco product  because it is a component of a tobacco product  People use it to vaporize nicotine containing eliquid   Any other liquid that is designed to be put in a vaporizer is also a tobacco product  because its being used in a tobacco product   I understand why the FDA kept their mouth shut and stuck with the  case by case  line   But nicopure not addressing that dog shit logic annoys me *missed dubious logic fda used publically stating reason zero nicotine included neither fda nicopure complainants brought briefs vaporizer tobacco product component tobacco product people use vaporize nicotine containing eliquid liquid designed put vaporizer also tobacco product used tobacco product understand fda kept mouth shut stuck case case line nicopure addressing dog shit logic annoys

6335*Yep if it is not a tobacco product then it is a drug and falls under existing FDA control   Catch 22  The FDA could require prescriptions for it if they want since it can be deadly if misused  Or banned   The only thing that stopped the FDA from banning vaping a few years ago was that the nic was declared to be a tobacco product      *yep tobacco product drug falls existing fda control catch 22 fda could require prescriptions want since deadly misused banned thing stopped fda banning years ago nic declared tobacco product
6336*So NKTR and all those other TFN brands are street legal *nktr tfn brands street legal
6337*Tobacco products are actually astoundingly unregulated and are exempted from a huge amount of controls that other products are subject to  This is not a good thing at all  It opens the door for them to be regulated as drugs  with a fuck ton more rules    Think about any other product with the health impact of tobacco being introduced to the market and how regulators would respond to it  Tobacco gets a pass because because of its established position *tobacco products actually astoundingly unregulated exempted huge amount controls products subject good thing opens door regulated drugs fuck ton rules think product health impact tobacco introduced market regulators would respond tobacco gets pass established position

6861*Id call a lawyer immediately and sue for wrongful termination  Edit noticed youre in canada  a quick lookup of the laws leads me to believe since you didnt violate any workplace procedure they couldnt terminate you without reasonable notice  So they could have said you have  x  number of days left here and not been in violation but if that didnt happen they are in the wrong  Also the law says they basically have to pay your unemployment for doing this out of pocket and can not reinstate you *id call lawyer immediately sue wrongful termination edit noticed youre canada quick lookup laws leads believe since didnt violate workplace procedure couldnt terminate without reasonable notice could said x number days left violation didnt happen wrong also law says basically pay unemployment pocket reinstate
6862*I strongly urge everyone here to email ECTA and ask them to revoke Premium Labs  st of approval   It is completely asinine for an organization that prides themselves on transparency to support a company that not only refuses to be transparent but that threatens a small business with litigation if they dont fire an employee for simply asking for lab results    Im never been a proponent of diketone free ejuice or mandatory disclosure but its another thing entirely for a company to claim to be diketone free and then when asked for proof to delete posts and force a company to fire its employees simply for asking for proof that their claims are true  *strongly urge everyone email ecta ask revoke premium labs st approval completely asinine organization prides transparency support company refuses transparent threatens small business litigation dont fire employee simply asking lab results im never proponent diketone free ejuice mandatory disclosure another thing entirely company claim diketone free asked proof delete posts force company fire employees simply asking proof claims true
6863* Premium Labs contacted my employers and threatened to sue them   You asked them for something they are by law or policy supposed to provide and they threaten to sue your employer if they didnt not fire you for making this request   Further  they found out exactly who your employer was by nefarious means and used that against you   Right now what you should be doing is looking for the best attorney in this particular legal area you can find   spare no cost  sue for attorney fees    and you should sue both the company and your employer   your employer should also lawyer up and sue for any threats made by the employee of the Lab   immediately   Litigation used as a form of intimidation that results in you losing your livelihood is a clear violation of your civil rights   I realize this is Canada  so there are some differences in the law and procedure  However  there are few differences in the civilized world when a job is lost due to litigation as intimidation   You poked a wasps nest when you got curious about the publics safety and health and found a bully viper who apparently doesnt understand even the basics of business and law   If you do not know where to find the best attorney in your area for this violation head over to the university law school and make your way around the departments  You might also wish to find out which politicians lean towards the protection of workers rights and civil liberties   If what you say is true  the person who got you fired is about to put the company in jeopardy and could end up doing some time himself  This is a serious violation   Good Luck   p s    if your employer finally figures out how he violated the law  apologizes then offers you your job back  keep this in mind   he may hire you back and later fire you for other reasons  Find a new job  do not go back  report what happen to you to the unemployment board   get it on official record today  right now      *premium labs contacted employers threatened sue asked something law policy supposed provide threaten sue employer didnt fire making request found exactly employer nefarious means used right looking best attorney particular legal area find spare cost sue attorney fees sue company employer employer also lawyer sue threats made employee lab immediately litigation used form intimidation results losing livelihood clear violation civil rights realize canada differences law procedure however differences civilized world job lost due litigation intimidation poked wasps nest got curious publics safety health found bully viper apparently doesnt understand even basics business law know find best attorney area violation head university law school make way around departments might also wish find politicians lean towards protection workers rights civil liberties say true person got fired put company jeopardy could end time serious violation good luck p employer finally figures violated law apologizes offers job back keep mind may hire back later fire reasons find new job go back report happen unemployment board get official record today right
6864*Sue your former employer and Premium Labs  What they did was illegal  They cannot blackmail someone in order to get you fired  At least at minimum  file a complaint with the labor board *sue former employer premium labs illegal cannot blackmail someone order get fired least minimum file complaint labor board
6865*Oh wow  what a disgusting prick   u Fulldiscolure   Sammy Fog   whoever you are  learn to spell maybe     if this is true    I live in Canada  Ive never bought a juice from any of your brands  and now  I never will  I am not a fan of Vapour Solutions  even less so now  but at least theyve never done something so pathetic   Sad to hear OP   Edit   italics  also  note that I am in no way endorsing the truthfulness of the statements made by  u scoobydoot  I have no opinion as to whether this all happened as they say it did  All of my comments in this thread are in the spirit of  if this is true  *oh wow disgusting prick u fulldiscolure sammy fog whoever learn spell maybe true live canada ive never bought juice brands never fan vapour solutions even less least theyve never done something pathetic sad hear op edit italics also note way endorsing truthfulness statements made u scoobydoot opinion whether happened say comments thread spirit true
6866*You may have lost your job  but try to come out of it with dignity  The fact that they wouldnt give you the test results shows an error on their part   From your original thread   and I avoid any brands that cant provide a lab test because vaping that stuff causes me severe reactions in my airways and its not worth the risk  Recovery from a reaction can take a few days normally  Im aware that some vendors make it known about acetyl propionyl or diacetyl  or anything else that might be harmful in liquids  Hopefully it will become a standard that they link to their results on site instead of simply posting them on reddit  for actual accountability  I remember that word being a big thing at least a year ago   Simply saying so in a privacy policy or in a disclaimer isnt enough  but thats just my view *may lost job try come dignity fact wouldnt give test results shows error part original thread avoid brands cant provide lab test stuff causes severe reactions airways worth risk recovery reaction take days normally im aware vendors make known acetyl propionyl diacetyl anything else might harmful liquids hopefully become standard link results site instead simply posting reddit actual accountability remember word big thing least year ago simply saying privacy policy disclaimer isnt enough thats view

6884*Eating  drinking and vaping are all natural for 21st century homo sapiens   So even those who cant eat food or drink liquids will still naturally vape to enjoy life     Edit  Its not really as complicated as fascists want to make it   Eating and drinking are supposedly  deadly  too  hence the attacks on all sorts of food  calorie starved school kids and the bans on Big Gulps and such   Vaping is being assaulted on that same level as  dangerous    Thats the most important thing to understand   Its pre danger behavior control *eating drinking natural 21st century homo sapiens even cant eat food drink liquids still naturally enjoy life edit really complicated fascists want make eating drinking supposedly deadly hence attacks sorts food calorie starved school kids bans big gulps assaulted level dangerous thats important thing understand pre danger behavior control

6940*I doubt wed ever do that in America for concerns of theft  Were already making a big enough deal about teen vaping and that would just allow easy access to free vapes and juice  When I was a young teen they used to have packs of cigarettes at the end of the isle in grocery stores and I am guilty of snagging many packs  When youre a young stupid nicotine addict its way too tempting with such easy access *doubt wed ever america concerns theft already making big enough deal teen would allow easy access free vapes juice young teen used packs cigarettes end isle grocery stores guilty snagging many packs youre young stupid nicotine addict way tempting easy access
6941*This makes me happy to see some level of acceptance and understanding  and yet so sad at the same time knowing just how stupid and ignorant people lawmakers are here in the states   Is putting anything in your lungs other than air safe  Probably not  but the vaping community has never claimed vaping to be harmless  They simply encourage it to be a tool to help people quit  which Ive seen countless people do thanks to vaping or to give people a  safer  alternative  But the ebb and flow of it all boils down to money and who controls what market share    Big Tobacco has lost millions of customers  and fewer people are getting cancer  and the drug companies arent liking that one bit  So theyre trying to give vaping a bad rap  Which is sad  because theyd rather have more people smoking and getting cancer or other diseases caused by smoking  just to make a profit from the drugs and care they provide  Less sick people means fewer drugs being needed  means less profit for them  And its why no matter how many times you read about promising cancer cures or treatments  that they will never become available to us  At least not any time soon  A cure demotes the continued necessity of pumping out more drugs and making more money  Im willing to bet cancer could have been cured ages ago  But we wont ever have access or knowledge to those treatments  All in the name of profits and greed *makes happy see level acceptance understanding yet sad time knowing stupid ignorant people lawmakers states putting anything lungs air safe probably community never claimed harmless simply encourage tool help people quit ive seen countless people thanks give people safer alternative ebb flow boils money controls market share big tobacco lost millions customers fewer people getting cancer drug companies arent liking one bit theyre trying give bad rap sad theyd rather people smoking getting cancer diseases caused smoking make profit drugs care provide less sick people means fewer drugs needed means less profit matter many times read promising cancer cures treatments never become available us least time soon cure demotes continued necessity pumping drugs making money im willing bet cancer could cured ages ago wont ever access knowledge treatments name profits greed

6943*When I was a kid  my friends who smoked would come out of the grocery store with a sleeve full of cig packs  It was easy to get hooked on smokes  They were  1 48 for Marlboros  I think rather than legislate behavior  which never works  the U S  should just make access to nic harder  Dont eliminate this or that  but if youre old enough  you should be able to buy whatever  I see toothpicks  losenges  etc  sitting at checkout by the gum and candy  yet vape juice is locked up as if its a danger to the public   Another issue is that Juul pods have gigantic amounts of nic and give most vaping a bad name  I use  3mg and  6mg per ml ejuice  and yet some Juul devices have as much as 60mg  I know the devices are different  but nobody who doesnt vape know that  so it all gets demonized *kid friends smoked would come grocery store sleeve full cig packs easy get hooked smokes 1 48 marlboros think rather legislate behavior never works u make access nic harder dont eliminate youre old enough able buy whatever see toothpicks losenges etc sitting checkout gum candy yet juice locked danger public another issue juul pods gigantic amounts nic give bad name use 3mg 6mg per ml ejuice yet juul devices much 60mg know devices different nobody doesnt know gets demonized

6953*This law is rotten with the distinct smell of quid pro quo when apparently  1  its written in a manner that requires security contracting in which only one company  which  happens  to be located in Indiana  that can  2  approve or deny any e liquid company it sees fit   3  has no accountability for any company it denies   4  has refused GoodCat with no explanation   5  refused to reply to inquiries from GoodCat in its attempt to comply   6  and the law is written so specifically with requirements seemingly unrelated to eliquid production quality standards that it seems obviously intended to exclude all other security companies except the one   This is like putting a contract out for bid for appearance of an impartial and fair bidding process  while tailoring the RFP so that only one desired company could possibly qualify  completely subverting the intent of a fair bidding process   Someone needs to research the donations to the politicians who voted for this law or who administer it to see if this security company or its owners made contributions that have been disclosed *law rotten distinct smell quid pro quo apparently 1 written manner requires security contracting one company happens located indiana 2 approve deny e liquid company sees fit 3 accountability company denies 4 refused goodcat explanation 5 refused reply inquiries goodcat attempt comply 6 law written specifically requirements seemingly unrelated eliquid production quality standards seems obviously intended exclude security companies except one like putting contract bid appearance impartial fair bidding process tailoring rfp one desired company could possibly qualify completely subverting intent fair bidding process someone needs research donations politicians voted law administer see security company owners made contributions disclosed

6958*The headline is  as far as I can tell after having read the ruling  misleading at best   The judge didnt rule that the law was unconstitutional  He ruled that the plaintiffs case had enough chance of winning on that point  that issuing a preliminary injunction is justified  The framework a judge uses for that determination is a lower bar than an actual finding that the law is unconstitutional would require   Any ruling that the law is actually unconstitutional would come later on in the case   Dont get me wrong   the ruling is a win  Its just not a final yep  unconstitutional ruling in the way the articles headline asserts *headline far tell read ruling misleading best judge didnt rule law unconstitutional ruled plaintiffs case enough chance winning point issuing preliminary injunction justified framework judge uses determination lower bar actual finding law unconstitutional would require ruling law actually unconstitutional would come later case dont get wrong ruling win final yep unconstitutional ruling way articles headline asserts

7093*this is what i sent to him  wall text incoming    I would like to talk to you about the currently stagnant electronic cigarette industry  It has been proven time and time again that vaping is a safer alternative to smoking by about    Oh  95% give or take by independent studies across the world  I do not know how appropriate it is to actually put links in this letter  so i wont  However  a simple google search of  vaping is safer than smoking  will absolutely bombard whoever so desires to browse it with sourced and cited information regarding its safety and use as a smoking cessation device  In fact  I havent smoked in 6 years because of it and  to be honest  havent felt better in my adult life  Not to mention that its quite enjoyable being a human fog machine from time to time  if Im honest  I only ask that you suspend FDA regulations on the devices and liquids for the time being due to that fact that it has more to do with pharmaceutical companies losing out on making money with their nicotine patches and gums  and big tobaccos cigarette sales  One of these barely works if cited studies are to be believed  and cigarettes and cigars are just plain killing thousands of americans a year  Perhaps a revision of safety devices on the e cigs in question would be a better idea as it is a fact that improper storage or placement in the pocket could cause battery detonation  A safety program would work best maybe  Like with a firearm  anything inherently dangerous in regards to its hardware needs to be able to be deactivated while being carried about  and analog vape devices  or  mechanical  mods  do indeed have a safety  but it is a rudimentary screw down ring around the baseplate that you press to activate the device  perhaps instead of focusing on the chemicals  which have already been individually approved by the Fda as it is  we could instead focus on the aspect of an automatically resetting safety that one would have to turn off in order to use  Once the initial use of the moment is done  said safety simply falls back into place by way of a gentle spring or gravity  something that would prevent unintended activation of the device without the actual need for the user to have to worry about screwing down a ring or penti tapping the power button in a moment when quick use of the hands is necessary  Glocks patented  safe action  comes to mind  no accidents  no immediate intervention  just push the button and you get what you want  dont push the button  and nothing happens  Im looking forward to hearing back on the matter either through legislation  or via email  whichever is most appropriate     ps  i willingly voted for you  i have faith in what you can do  i genuinely hope and pray you will make this country great again  *sent wall text incoming would like talk currently stagnant electronic cigarette industry proven time time safer alternative smoking oh 95 % give take independent studies across world know appropriate actually put links letter wont however simple google search safer smoking absolutely bombard whoever desires browse sourced cited information regarding safety use smoking cessation device fact havent smoked 6 years honest havent felt better adult life mention quite enjoyable human fog machine time time im honest ask suspend fda regulations devices liquids time due fact pharmaceutical companies losing making money nicotine patches gums big tobaccos cigarette sales one barely works cited studies believed cigarettes cigars plain killing thousands americans year perhaps revision safety devices e cigs question would better idea fact improper storage placement pocket could cause battery detonation safety program would work best maybe like firearm anything inherently dangerous regards hardware needs able deactivated carried analog devices mechanical mods indeed safety rudimentary screw ring around baseplate press activate device perhaps instead focusing chemicals already individually approved fda could instead focus aspect automatically resetting safety one would turn order use initial use moment done said safety simply falls back place way gentle spring gravity something would prevent unintended activation device without actual need user worry screwing ring penti tapping power button moment quick use hands necessary glocks patented safe action comes mind accidents immediate intervention push button get want dont push button nothing happens im looking forward hearing back matter either legislation via email whichever appropriate ps willingly voted faith genuinely hope pray make country great
7094*Im sure it will be down voted into obscurity  but I find it refreshing that President Elect Trump seems to actually WANT to know what the American people think  as opposed to not caring and doing the partys own thing     Now this could all be that he doesnt have a clue on what to do next because he never expected to win  but I can hope     Edit  I will stand on my first statement alone *im sure voted obscurity find refreshing president elect trump seems actually want know american people think opposed caring partys thing could doesnt clue next never expected win hope edit stand first statement alone

7145*Overall I like it but I reflexively put on my  What possible note could my boss have   hat   I would recommend putting Believe the Science on its own line   At first glance it could mistakenly be interpreted to be meaning something similar to  Scientists believe e cigs to be 95% less harmful   just by the brain taking in all the words all at once and trying to make sense of them after the fact    On a billboard most of your market is driving by quickly and will only glance briefly  So putting space between the 2 statements will cause people see them properly   Also putting the   logo between them instead of a period could help  and potentially allow you to use up more space in total by condensing everything together  *overall like reflexively put possible note could boss hat would recommend putting believe science line first glance could mistakenly interpreted meaning something similar scientists believe e cigs 95 % less harmful brain taking words trying make sense fact billboard market driving quickly glance briefly putting space 2 statements cause people see properly also putting logo instead period could help potentially allow use space total condensing everything together

7159*This bill would ban e cigarette use everywhere in New York that smoking is banned   Vapers should oppose this  Throughout New York there are likely hundreds if not thousands of bars  restaurants  private workplaces  etc  that allow or turn a blind eye to the respectful use of electronic cigarettes indoors   When it is January and 10 degrees outside  and a business owner wants to allow it  why should the e cigarette user have to go outside   Its always amazing how complacent some vapers are with getting thrown under the bus alongside smokers   Yes  in some social situations it may be inappropriate to vape  but that does NOT mean it is inappropriate in all indoor and some outdoor public places    Another thing to keep in mind  The Senator pushing this bill is also the lead sponsor on a bill to ban the sale of e liquid to adults   Do we really want to give him a win *bill would ban e cigarette use everywhere new york smoking banned vapers oppose throughout new york likely hundreds thousands bars restaurants private workplaces etc allow turn blind eye respectful use electronic cigarettes indoors january 10 degrees outside business owner wants allow e cigarette user go outside always amazing complacent vapers getting thrown bus alongside smokers yes social situations may inappropriate mean inappropriate indoor outdoor public places another thing keep mind senator pushing bill also lead sponsor bill ban sale e liquid adults really want give win

7171*I cant believe this is so hard for you all to understand  Smoking has been associated with the visual of smoke leaving your mouth as long as its been around  Vaping gives the same image as smoking  To the general population  they dont give a crap what it is as to what it looks like  Vaping simply gives the same look as smoking an analog  So the population is going to want it to be regulated just like smoking  because all of a sudden  there is a loophole in the  no smoking  laws in public spaces  So of course people are going to complain  because it looks like youre smoking where you shouldnt  As for the bill itself  in all honesty theres a huge chance it will pass  What we should all focus our energy on is the repercussion   once it passes  To prove to the state that it is not as harmful as cigarettes and should not be treated as such *cant believe hard understand smoking associated visual smoke leaving mouth long around gives image smoking general population dont give crap looks like simply gives look smoking analog population going want regulated like smoking sudden loophole smoking laws public spaces course people going complain looks like youre smoking shouldnt bill honesty theres huge chance pass focus energy repercussion passes prove state harmful cigarettes treated

7205*Hey  non vaper from  r all here  While I dont know enough about the product or new regulations to weigh in on their reasonableness or lack thereof   it sounds like the FDA is completely ignoring the use of ecigs as an alternative to smoking    The FDA should have at least crafted an exception where physicians can prescribe ecigs to patients looking to quit smoking  And while I am not sure what health issues are associated with ecigs  I imagine they must pale in comparison to the  known  and  well documented  damage tar ridden tobacco cigarettes causes to the body  *hey non vaper r dont know enough product new regulations weigh reasonableness lack thereof sounds like fda completely ignoring use ecigs alternative smoking fda least crafted exception physicians prescribe ecigs patients looking quit smoking sure health issues associated ecigs imagine must pale comparison known well documented damage tar ridden tobacco cigarettes causes body

7635*Just my 2cents  I loved going on fb and seeing how many people quit cigs by vaping  But a lot of these have their own sets of comments that are turning into flame wars   If youre doing this  please stop  Giving them links to relevant safety information  or explaining facts about nicotine and vaping is helpful to our cause  Bashing an ignorant anti vaper and engaging in name calling is not  Let the anti vaper   not the vaper  come across as the aggressive  mean spirited  and inflammatory person   Not trying to squash the freedom of speech of those who wish to flame  but the vaping community is already under enough opposition  lets at least have a modest amount of decorum *2cents loved going fb seeing many people quit cigs lot sets comments turning flame wars youre please stop giving links relevant safety information explaining facts nicotine helpful cause bashing ignorant anti vaper engaging name calling let anti vaper vaper come across aggressive mean spirited inflammatory person trying squash freedom speech wish flame community already enough opposition lets least modest amount decorum

7638*The amazing thing is  every time anyone asks the internet what saved their life from cigarettes or smoking the answer is always vaping   Check out every comment underneath some type of cigarette news article or FB post  the American Heart Association and even the American Cancer Society which had its fair share of heat in the past when they were bashing Groupon for promoting an ecig deal   They will most likely ignore the 99% of Vapor replies but its so refreshing to see the wonderful stories of people quitting smoking cigarettes just like it was for us yesterday *amazing thing every time anyone asks internet saved life cigarettes smoking answer always check every comment underneath type cigarette news article fb post american heart association even american cancer society fair share heat past bashing groupon promoting deal likely ignore 99 % vapor replies refreshing see wonderful stories people quitting smoking cigarettes like us yesterday

7652*PELs should definitely be a major factor in these studies  Especially when they brought up popcorn lung back in 2016  If you compare the exposure limits from vaping to industry standards placed by companies such as OSHA you will find they are well below the PEL allowed and deemed safe  I learned this in my intro to OSH class when we talked about the major diacetly incident that took place in a popcorn factory  For any independent study it all PELs are readily available online as required by law and if vapes were to exceed that Im sure they would have been cut from the market by now *pels definitely major factor studies especially brought popcorn lung back 2016 compare exposure limits industry standards placed companies osha find well pel allowed deemed safe learned intro osh class talked major diacetly incident took place popcorn factory independent study pels readily available online required law vapes exceed im sure would cut market

7665*So  you can go into a store and buy cigarettes that WILL kill you  and thats fine by the FDA because  you know the risks    But you go into a vape shop and buy a setup that MIGHT  MIGHT   cause health problems in 40 years  and were not allowed to because there isnt any evidence that it will kill us  So unless its 100% proven to cause cancer  we arent allowed to make up our own damn minds as adults  What fucking planet am I living on *go store buy cigarettes kill thats fine fda know risks go shop buy setup might might cause health problems 40 years allowed isnt evidence kill us unless 100 % proven cause cancer arent allowed make damn minds adults fucking planet living

7696*I really wish it was more clear at what point we are pushing it too far  and producing formaldehyde    I seem to recall the study saying 5volts was producing formaldehyde while 3volts wasnt  I was alarmed since I often run at that level  But when I tried 3volts  I was getting next to no vapour production    So then I read that it actually depends on how many ohms your atomizer is at too  I found a chart online that indicated that with my 1 8ohm head  that indeed I shouldnt be going over about 3 9 volts    Later  I then read  that Im using a dual coil atomizer  so that in fact that chart is not necessarily accurate unless I multiple the ohms by two  giving me 3 6 ohms    Im using a Provari with an Aspire Nautilus Tank  and 1 8ohm atomizers   dual coil as far as I understand  I just want to know what voltages are considered safe  *really wish clear point pushing far producing formaldehyde seem recall study saying 5volts producing formaldehyde 3volts wasnt alarmed since often run level tried 3volts getting next vapour production read actually depends many ohms atomizer found chart online indicated 1 8ohm head indeed shouldnt going 3 9 volts later read im using dual coil atomizer fact chart necessarily accurate unless multiple ohms two giving 3 6 ohms im using provari aspire nautilus tank 1 8ohm atomizers dual coil far understand want know voltages considered safe

7715*Wow  Their logic is supremely fucked *wow logic supremely fucked
7716*Definition of a  vapor product  per the bill   Vapor product  means a noncombustible product that contains or is made or derived from nicotine  that is intended and marketed for human consumption  including by smoking  inhaling  snorting  or sniffing  and that includes any component  part  or additive that is intended for use in a mechanical heating element  battery  or electronic circuit and is used to deliver the product   Vapor product  does not include any product that is a drug  device  or combination product  as those terms are defined or described in 21 U S C  321 or 353 g    Vapor product  includes any product containing nicotine  regardless of concentration   So  nic free e liquid are not included in this tax  Theoretically  you can avoid the majority of the tax by selling 0 nic for the bulk and get taxed on a  booster shot  of 100 mg ml which you are supposed to add at home  Which would be perfectly safe for ordinary folks   s  So  30 mg 0 nic  2 ml 100 mg ml  end up with 32 ml  6 25 mg ml  gets taxed  2 25 as opposed to  33 75  You can probably do better with pure nicotine  1000 mg ml   but that would just be silly  right   A safer alternative is using doublers or triplers like the Aussies do  Still have to mix at home  but with a more reasonable concentration  e g  24 mg ml  36 mg ml    All in all  the wording in the inserted portion of the bill sounds like it was written by one of the major anti vaping groups  ALA  etc   It also includes a lot of specific licensing for  vapor dealers   Contact your Ohio House member and express your dismay at this outrageous cash grab   a cash grab which may end up costing Ohioans their lives by continuing to feed their nicotine dependence via cigarettes  as it would be undeniably the cheaper option *definition vapor product per bill vapor product means noncombustible product contains made derived nicotine intended marketed human consumption including smoking inhaling snorting sniffing includes component part additive intended use mechanical heating element battery electronic circuit used deliver product vapor product include product drug device combination product terms defined described 21 u c 321 353 g vapor product includes product containing nicotine regardless concentration nic free e liquid included tax theoretically avoid majority tax selling 0 nic bulk get taxed booster shot 100 mg ml supposed add home would perfectly safe ordinary folks 30 mg 0 nic 2 ml 100 mg ml end 32 ml 6 25 mg ml gets taxed 2 25 opposed 33 75 probably better pure nicotine 1000 mg ml would silly right safer alternative using doublers triplers like aussies still mix home reasonable concentration e g 24 mg ml 36 mg ml wording inserted portion bill sounds like written one major anti groups ala etc also includes lot specific licensing vapor dealers contact ohio house member express dismay outrageous cash grab cash grab may end costing ohioans lives continuing feed nicotine dependence via cigarettes would undeniably cheaper option

7718*I can see it now  Theyre going to shut down the Mountaineer and reopen it as the Mountaineer Vaporeum    Wheeling suddenly becomes the E Cigarette capital of the Ohio Valley  and a new dawn of prosperity is seen in the West Virginia panhandle    Seriously though  Ohio is a conservative state when you look at state politics  Lean on your state rep  lean on your state senator  Play the tea party angle if you have to  They might actually listen because being  that guy that raised taxes and destroyed jobs  is not a label you want to have when its election time *see theyre going shut mountaineer reopen mountaineer vaporeum wheeling suddenly becomes e cigarette capital ohio valley new dawn prosperity seen west virginia panhandle seriously though ohio conservative state look state politics lean state rep lean state senator play tea party angle might actually listen guy raised taxes destroyed jobs label want election time

7721*So ostensibly speaking   why are they taxing vapor liquid products   Its not so much that theyre taxing x per amount  but what is the justification for them taxing at all   I will freely admit that I may have a libertarian leaning  but this is just ridiculous *ostensibly speaking taxing vapor liquid products much theyre taxing x per amount justification taxing freely admit may libertarian leaning ridiculous
7723*So if you purchase 30ml with 0mg of nic you wouldnt have to pay tax right  How could they justify it by saying its  equals 300  cigarettes when they dont have nicotine less cigarettes    Also couldnt you just buy a big bottle of nic and mix it in yourself after the fact *purchase 30ml 0mg nic wouldnt pay tax right could justify saying equals 300 cigarettes dont nicotine less cigarettes also couldnt buy big bottle nic mix fact
7724*As a manager of a tobacconist in Ohio  Id like to say there is a pretty big group fighting this budget right now   The OPCPA  of which pretty much every major tobacconist in Ohio has joined up with  put on a number of fundraisers last year to hire a lobbyist against these proposed taxes  and they are in the middle of meetings with the governors office and fighting this as we speak   While it was formed at first to address taxes on cigars and pipe tobaccos  this budget calling for a raise from the current 17% to a 60% tax   the goal now is to fight all smoking related taxes  including this eCig one   As of right now  Ive been informed that the best thing we can do at the moment is contact our representatives and Kasich himself about how these taxes will kill businesses in Ohio   It doesnt take long to write and send a letter  so Id encourage everyone to do so  as every little bit helps *manager tobacconist ohio id like say pretty big group fighting budget right opcpa pretty much every major tobacconist ohio joined put number fundraisers last year hire lobbyist proposed taxes middle meetings governors office fighting speak formed first address taxes cigars pipe tobaccos budget calling raise current 17 % 60 % tax goal fight smoking related taxes including one right ive informed best thing moment contact representatives kasich taxes kill businesses ohio doesnt take long write send letter id encourage everyone every little bit helps
7725*Was really hoping Ohio would stay out of this until more states got involved and the taxing got more reasonable   I guess Ill start doing diy if this passes *really hoping ohio would stay states got involved taxing got reasonable guess ill start diy passes

7728*Who is paying them off to be so against vape flavors  Fuck kids  no one tried to ban cigs because they were being sold to people under 18   can they just stop and realize how corrupt they are *paying flavors fuck kids one tried ban cigs sold people 18 stop realize corrupt

7730*Its almost like other countries use common sense before just trying to ban everything  *almost like countries use common sense trying ban everything
7731*The U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has reported a significant increase in the use of vaping products by youth in the United States  As a result  the FDA has announced new measures to restrict youth access to vaping products and new restrictions on flavoured tobacco products   While Canada has not seen a similar spike in the use of vaping products by youth   Makes you wonder if our politicians could have their caigns funded by big tobacco  if the results of those studies would be different    All it takes a bit of smudging in criteria used to define a couple of their terms and all of a sudden all those kids that were smoking cigarettes that switched to harm reduction make vaping rates look like an epidemic  *u food drug administration fda reported significant increase use products youth united states result fda announced new measures restrict youth access products new restrictions flavoured tobacco products canada seen similar spike use products youth makes wonder politicians could caigns funded big tobacco results studies would different takes bit smudging criteria used define couple terms sudden kids smoking cigarettes switched harm reduction make rates look like epidemic
7732*The amount of Advocacy we pushed on the government while they were drafting regulations was substantial  from rallys to lawyers to pushing industry experts  health experts and essentially educating politicians on the science surrounding vapor products definitely paid off for Canada   The sheer amount of people that came forward to help and not just vape shops industry  every day citizens doing things like contacting their MPs  scheduling appointments with them just to talk about vaping was insane  they were inundated and had no choice but to listen *amount advocacy pushed government drafting regulations substantial rallys lawyers pushing industry experts health experts essentially educating politicians science surrounding vapor products definitely paid canada sheer amount people came forward help shops industry every day citizens things like contacting mps scheduling appointments talk insane inundated choice listen

7734*Good on canada  My home and  on  native land  But really  i didnt know that adults dont eat flavoured icecream  just bland ice  we also dont eat fruit  just vegetables  While were at it lets try to ban orange flavoured liqueurs  because lord knows if a 12 year old buys blue curacao its not because the liquor store worker is irresponsible  its because the company forgot that sugar is only for kids *good canada home native land really didnt know adults dont eat flavoured icecream bland ice also dont eat fruit vegetables lets try ban orange flavoured liqueurs lord knows 12 year old buys blue curacao liquor store worker irresponsible company forgot sugar kids
7735*And here on Finland only flavour accepted is tobacco and only from stores that have permits *finland flavour accepted tobacco stores permits
7737*Honestly  I kinda feel like if they were to ban the yummy flavours and only keep the yuckier ones  then kids teens would probably be like    well the both taste bad now  and cigs are easier to get  so lets just smoke instead of vape    which would be worse for them*honestly kinda feel like ban yummy flavours keep yuckier ones kids teens would probably like well taste bad cigs easier get lets smoke instead would worse

7760*Well  according to their broadening of the definition  tomatoes  eggplants  potatoes  papaya  coca  and many other plants are all taxable  tobacco products  since they  contain nicotine and are intended for human consumption    If this passes theyll be rich   Er  well the education system or whatever will be rich *well according broadening definition tomatoes eggplants potatoes papaya coca many plants taxable tobacco products since contain nicotine intended human consumption passes theyll rich er well education system whatever rich

7769*You really have to appreciate the delicious irony of whats going on here   The US Government  WITH YOUR SUPPORT   started taxing the holy living hell out of tobacco about 25 years ago  They did this under the battle cry that raising taxes would cause people to quit smoking and every will live for ever and ever in the land of milk and honey  with no medical problems ever     The problem starts here because a vast majority of our citizens   even smokers  had been convinced that smoking was the root of all health problems in this country   So we let our non smoking neighbors impose taxes to the tune of up to 500% or more in some cases   No one bitched because it was not politically correct to argue FOR tobacco users   Everyone ate that shit sammich and started passing state laws to tax tobacco users to death      E cigarettes came about not because of technology  but because there was a terrific demand for them  Nicotine itself will not kill you   It is a mild stimulant and sedative and addictive as all hell  Nothing more really  We just needed a cheaper way to get it without Uncle Sam cleaning out our wallet in the process   So their argument that they need to tax ecigs for medical reasons suddenly becomes mute   This is where you really have them by the balls   There is no justification at all for such a ridiculous tax  You need to challenge them to give you one      Governments got pretty fat on our unjust taxes over the last 25 years  and now they are starting to see those revenues drop because of the exodus to e cigs   What they are doing is EXACTLY the kind of crap that caused the Civil War   Our state and federal legislators need to be reminded that this kind of cash grab behavior aimed at anyone but themselves WILL NOT BE TOLERATED  And we need to mean it   Your legislators need to be brought to task on this   They need to be GRILLED on where this proposed tax would go   How exactly will it benefit those who are paying it and what benefit will it bring to them   Get the media involved   I mean REALLY get the media involved   Start asking all these questions to reporters covering this issue   If they are not covering it  you need to be asking why   You guys are sitting on a pivotal moment in history   Are you going to just watch it happen and whine when it does  Or are you going to do something   ORGANIZE   Network  call every vape shop in the state and start planning   Make posters  might I suggest  NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION  to start  and protest like you really mean it   Tell them that they need to justify such a ridiculous tax   Suggest instead that they impose it on sugar   Surely obesity is a much larger problem than e cigs   We are ready to stand  at least I am   As I am sure others are   This is  a state issue for now  but its going to grow   If you let it slide without a huge fight  you are making it easier for them to target the rest of us   So I we will help you as best we can I suppose  but you need to organize and work from there   Please keep updating   If there is help you need that this community can give  I am sure they will   EDIT  Revolutionary war   sorry*really appreciate delicious irony whats going us government support started taxing holy living hell tobacco 25 years ago battle cry raising taxes would cause people quit smoking every live ever ever land milk honey medical problems ever problem starts vast majority citizens even smokers convinced smoking root health problems country let non smoking neighbors impose taxes tune 500 % cases one bitched politically correct argue tobacco users everyone ate shit sammich started passing state laws tax tobacco users death e cigarettes came technology terrific demand nicotine kill mild stimulant sedative addictive hell nothing really needed cheaper way get without uncle sam cleaning wallet process argument need tax ecigs medical reasons suddenly becomes mute really balls justification ridiculous tax need challenge give one governments got pretty fat unjust taxes last 25 years starting see revenues drop exodus e cigs exactly kind crap caused civil war state federal legislators need reminded kind cash grab behavior aimed anyone tolerated need mean legislators need brought task need grilled proposed tax would go exactly benefit paying benefit bring get media involved mean really get media involved start asking questions reporters covering issue covering need asking guys sitting pivotal moment history going watch happen whine going something organize network call every shop state start planning make posters might suggest taxation without representation start protest like really mean tell need justify ridiculous tax suggest instead impose sugar surely obesity much larger problem e cigs ready stand least sure others state issue going grow let slide without huge fight making easier target rest us help best suppose need organize work please keep updating help need community give sure edit revolutionary war sorry

7998*But    Its a proprietary premium alloy blend   for the best possible vaping experience  totally worth the cost   s  Im guilty of having bought  premium wire  in the past  although I always had issues with doing it  and it was often when I was out of wire and needed more  But I generally avoided it  For the longest time I tried to convince people in my local vape shop that its more than likely just repacked wire  but I never had any evidence and couldnt find any information on it    It seriously pisses me off that these companies pop up and take advantage of people  To me  its similar to the AV mods that everyone was hyping about last year and the year before  are they still a thing   Nearly everyone I knew was dropping  300 on those mods  and they were essentially just aluminum tubes  I knew a guy making minimum wage who was paying ABOVE MSRP for certain colored AV mods and cool buttons he wanted  He had at one point about 6 or 7 of them  I always refused but finally got to join the cool kids club when a friend decided to sell me two of his for much much much cheaper  I used them for all of 4 months  *proprietary premium alloy blend best possible experience totally worth cost im guilty bought premium wire past although always issues often wire needed generally avoided longest time tried convince people local shop likely repacked wire never evidence couldnt find information seriously pisses companies pop take advantage people similar av mods everyone hyping last year year still thing nearly everyone knew dropping 300 mods essentially aluminum tubes knew guy making minimum wage paying msrp certain colored av mods cool buttons wanted one point 6 7 always refused finally got join cool kids club friend decided sell two much much much cheaper used 4 months

8004*I have always refused to buy premium wire  Anyone who thinks the wire they buy for  10 for 5 feet being anything other than some random bulk wire the seller is buying for less than  10 for 100 feet and repackaging it at a major discount  is just asking to be fooled    The fact that most of them wont disclose the type of wire they use should be a dead giveaway that all they are doing is re branding some form of standard wire  Its just crazier though  because for anyone who cares about ohms law  you cannot accurately gauge in your head just how many wraps you need to get to x ohms  This is also how you get idiots trying to fire  08 ohm coils on 20 batteries  because they dont realize 5 wraps of that wire is not the same as 5 wraps of 24 gauge Kanthal   Too many people are just seeing vapers as walking money bags  As long as they come up with fancy names  packaging  and a video showing massive clouds  vapers will line up by the hundreds to hand over the money for that product  Most of them dont question anything  because they trust the seller 100% as being in it for their health *always refused buy premium wire anyone thinks wire buy 10 5 feet anything random bulk wire seller buying less 10 100 feet repackaging major discount asking fooled fact wont disclose type wire use dead giveaway branding form standard wire crazier though anyone cares ohms law cannot accurately gauge head many wraps need get x ohms also get idiots trying fire 08 ohm coils 20 batteries dont realize 5 wraps wire 5 wraps 24 gauge kanthal many people seeing vapers walking money bags long come fancy names packaging video showing massive clouds vapers line hundreds hand money product dont question anything trust seller 100 % health

8313*Every time Ive ordered from Fasttech I find that it always seems to fall on USPS and Customs  My last packages spent up to 10 days waiting for clearance  My most recent package from fasttech and its delay was 100% USPSs fault  The package after spending 10 days just to be accepted was then sent to a zip code 2 hours north of me   same numbers just in different order   I saw the tracking said it was out for delivery and then put in a claim because  I saw the picture of the packing label that Fasttech posted and it was correct  A few hours later I got a call from a woman from USPS in the local area and assured me that my package would be in my mailbox today and  packages leave from many different post offices   Well just as i suspected I later received a notification that for some reason the package needed to be forwarded due to a address problem  The next day I got the package   TL DR Fasttech is on point  USPS sucks *every time ive ordered fasttech find always seems fall usps customs last packages spent 10 days waiting clearance recent package fasttech delay 100 % uspss fault package spending 10 days accepted sent zip code 2 hours north numbers different order saw tracking said delivery put claim saw picture packing label fasttech posted correct hours later got call woman usps local area assured package would mailbox today packages leave many different post offices well suspected later received notification reason package needed forwarded due address problem next day got package tl dr fasttech point usps sucks

8338*So my college cus has been smoke free for a while now but only recently did they include e cigs and personal vaporizers into this rule  While i can understand not allowing vaping in the dorm rooms  i believe using them outside or atleast having better designated areas to use them  all we have is a few benches on the outer edge of cus   But posters like this really grind my gears because providing this kind of false information is what makes people think vaping is so bad and can stop people from switching to it to quit Cigarettes   2 is what really gets to me   Unlike tobacco leaves  liquid nicotine can be lethal when inhaled             WHAT    are you saying cigarettes and burning tobacco isnt lethal    Ive talked to a local B M right down the street  thank Thor its there  and they might possibly take action as posters like that are what keep people from vaping and possibly saving their lives*college cus smoke free recently include e cigs personal vaporizers rule understand allowing dorm rooms believe using outside atleast better designated areas use benches outer edge cus posters like really grind gears providing kind false information makes people think bad stop people switching quit cigarettes 2 really gets unlike tobacco leaves liquid nicotine lethal inhaled saying cigarettes burning tobacco isnt lethal ive talked local b right street thank thor might possibly take action posters like keep people possibly saving lives

8344*First off let me say that I have been off Analogs since 12 12 12  seemed to be a good day to do something memorable  and I dont condone Cancer sticks   But having said that  one of the reasons I smoked so long was I was sick of the lies   Smoking is not good for you  but my doctor says    Smoking will kill you   Well  NO  both my parents smoked all their lives and didnt die of anything smoking related not to mention George Burns 16 cigars a day   died at age 100   All your parents spent the early part of their lives exposed daily to second had smoke  and how may of that generation have you heard of that died of exposure to second hand smoke   2 Urologist 35 years apart said smoking can give you bladder cancer   Ill let you look up the side affects of a man having his bladder removed   My father said it gives a whole new meaning to the term  Dead Meat    And I first heard about this 35 years ago from my fathers Urologist  and then my own Urologist in 2012   So if I am to believe them  Urologist have known of this problem for 35 years and NOT told the anti smoking people about it   I mean if the anti smoking people could have said that smoking will give you a limp dick  why havent they   BECAUSE ITS A LIE   And such transparent lies insult my intelligence  and destroy any credibility the liar might have had   The problem is that the lie will persist   It must be true they printed it on that sign over there    I was in the hospital last June  people if you can manage it  dont get old    I was being pushed around the hospital on a gurney by a fellow I hope finds work in some profession out of hospitals   He asked what was that thing on the lanyard around my neck   I explained what is was  telling him that it had no tobacco  fire  smoke or any chemicals that could hurt him or me   He said there had to be something wrong with it   Then his face brightened and he said   Theres a battery in it  so there must be radiation               If it feels good there my be something wrong with it and you will die   If I wouldnt try it you shouldnt be able to do it   Ive only been asked once to not vape  and that was by a nurse who had never seen an e cig before and had gotten a complaint from some one else in the room   I told her what it was and that because of it  I hadnt smoked for 18 months  I finished with I know this can scare people  so I will stop scaring people   I then moved to a different part of the room  turned the voltage down  vaped but held the vapor in till it didnt show when I exhaled   Yea  if some one asks nicely  dont give them a reason to come back and tell you again   BUT When I see signs like this one I want to get all my vaping friends together and blow London fog at it and in the face of anyone who comes to complain   Because I am sick and tired being treated like a second class citizen based on LIES    *first let say analogs since 12 12 12 seemed good day something memorable dont condone cancer sticks said one reasons smoked long sick lies smoking good doctor says smoking kill well parents smoked lives didnt die anything smoking related mention george burns 16 cigars day died age 100 parents spent early part lives exposed daily second smoke may generation heard died exposure second hand smoke 2 urologist 35 years apart said smoking give bladder cancer ill let look side affects man bladder removed father said gives whole new meaning term dead meat first heard 35 years ago fathers urologist urologist 2012 believe urologist known problem 35 years told anti smoking people mean anti smoking people could said smoking give limp dick havent lie transparent lies insult intelligence destroy credibility liar might problem lie persist must true printed sign hospital last june people manage dont get old pushed around hospital gurney fellow hope finds work profession hospitals asked thing lanyard around neck explained telling tobacco fire smoke chemicals could hurt said something wrong face brightened said theres battery must radiation feels good something wrong die wouldnt try shouldnt able ive asked nurse never seen e cig gotten complaint one else room told hadnt smoked 18 months finished know scare people stop scaring people moved different part room turned voltage vaped held vapor till didnt show exhaled yea one asks nicely dont give reason come back tell see signs like one want get friends together blow london fog face anyone comes complain sick tired treated like second class citizen based lies
8345*Im sure  2 is right  and liquid nicotine can be lethal if inhaled  But thankfully e cigarettes turn that liquid nicotine into a vapor  which makes it pretty safe  *im sure 2 right liquid nicotine lethal inhaled thankfully e cigarettes turn liquid nicotine vapor makes pretty safe
8346*Second hand nicotine exposure  WTF is that *second hand nicotine exposure wtf
8347*For the lazy   Key conclusions      Even when compared to workplace standards for involuntary exposures  and using several conservative  erring on the side of caution  assumptions  the exposures from using e cigarettes fall well below the threshold for concern for compounds with known toxicity  That is  even ignoring the benefits of e cigarette use and the fact that the exposure is actively chosen  and even comparing to the levels that are considered unacceptable to people who are not benefiting from the exposure and do not want it  the exposures would not generate concern or call for remedial action       Expressed concerns about nicotine only apply to vapers who do not wish to consume it  a voluntary  indeed  intentional  exposure is very different from a contaminant       There is no serious concern about the contaminants such as volatile organic compounds  formaldehyde  acrolein  etc   in the liquid or produced by heating  While these contaminants are present  they have been detected at problematic levels only in a few studies that apparently were based on unrealistic levels of heating       The frequently stated concern about contamination of the liquid by a nontrivial quantity of ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol remains based on a single sle of an early technology product  and even this did not rise to the level of health concern  and has not been replicated       Tobacco specific nitrosamines  TSNA  are present in trace quantities and pose no more  likely much less  threat to health than TSNAs from modern smokeless tobacco products  which cause no measurable risk for cancer       Contamination by metals is shown to be at similarly trivial levels that pose no health risk  and the alarmist claims about such contamination are based on unrealistic assumptions about the molecular form of these elements       The existing literature tends to overestimate the exposures and exaggerate their implications  This is partially due to rhetoric  but also results from technical features  The most important is confusion of the concentration in aerosol  which on its own tells us little about risk to heath  with the relevant and much smaller total exposure to compounds in the aerosol averaged across all air inhaled in the course of a day  There is also clear bias in previous reports in favor of isolated instances of highest level of chemical detected across multiple studies  such that average exposure that can be calculated are higher than true value because they are    missing    all true zeros       Routine monitoring of liquid chemistry is easier and cheaper than assessment of aerosols  Combined with an understanding of how the chemistry of the liquid affects the chemistry of the aerosol and insights into behavior of vapers  this can serve as a useful tool to ensure the safety of e cigarettes       The only unintentional exposures  i e   not the nicotine  that seem to rise to the level that they are worth further research are the carrier chemicals themselves  propylene glycol and glycerin  This exposure is not known to cause health problems  but the magnitude of the exposure is novel and thus is at the levels for concern based on the lack of reassuring data *lazy key conclusions even compared workplace standards involuntary exposures using several conservative erring side caution assumptions exposures using e cigarettes fall well threshold concern compounds known toxicity even ignoring benefits e cigarette use fact exposure actively chosen even comparing levels considered unacceptable people

8354*The way I see it  if vaping flavors is such a concern and its apparently as they say causing health problems  they shouldnt ban them  they should let people do it with knowledge of the risk  Let people have control over their bodies ffs *way see flavors concern apparently say causing health problems shouldnt ban let people knowledge risk let people control bodies ffs
8357*As a resident of the UK Im very fortunate that we dont have to put up with the complete bs you guys do  The thing that infuriates me the most is the flavours are bad theory  Tobacco flavour vape is still flavoured  yet the FDA and CDC seem to consistently ignore that point   However after finding out about the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement  and the number of states that took stocks as well as payoffs things are becoming a little clearer to me now *resident uk im fortunate dont put complete bs guys thing infuriates flavours bad theory tobacco flavour still flavoured yet fda cdc seem consistently ignore point however finding tobacco master settlement agreement number states took stocks well payoffs things becoming little clearer

8364*Ive not told anyone that I vape in the 10 years or so that Ive been doing it  outside of my wife     When at the doctor or being asked by a nurse if I smoke the answer is  No    I simply didnt want the questions that sometimes come along with disclosing information like that  And with the recent panic thats going on Im happy that I didnt let anyone know  And my wife  one of the most panic stricken people that I personally know  isnt phased by the news reports at all  So even she knows this is BS *ive told anyone 10 years ive outside wife doctor asked nurse smoke answer simply didnt want questions sometimes come along disclosing information like recent panic thats going im happy didnt let anyone know wife one panic stricken people personally know isnt phased news reports even knows bs

8370*    Safety  Stay hydrated  This is generally good advice  but its important to know that vaping can dry you out and lead to faster dehydration   There is a simple trick to avoiding this  and this time it isnt vodka  Its water  DRINK WATER    Lastly  dont be dumb   Know the limits of your battery and dont push the resistance too low to make big clouds   You dont want it to vent   Vaping is much more difficult without lips or cheeks  and we dont need the bad press   If you need a towel to hold your mod  youre doing it wrong *safety stay hydrated generally good advice important know dry lead faster dehydration simple trick avoiding time isnt vodka water drink water lastly dont dumb know limits battery dont push resistance low make big clouds dont want vent much difficult without lips cheeks dont need bad press need towel hold mod youre wrong
8371*    Juice  When dealing with rebuildables  and drippers in particular  juice is important   High VG Juice becomes much more enjoyable  since you are getting much more flavor and OMG CLOUDS   PG becomes less important  and infact far less desirable since both the throat hit and the flavor are heavily lified     Most people also cut down their nic level by at least half when using a dripper   I found the same was true for me using an RDA and an RTA    I instantly dropped down from 18mg to 6mg   Even 12mg was unbearably harsh on my throat in my Taifun     You  can  cut your juice down with off the shelf  food grade  USP  glycerin   CVS carries this for about  6 for a small bottle in the skin care aisle   This is what I did   You will be sacrificing some flavor and will want it to steep a bit before using it again  shaking it 1 2 times a day   Youll also notice that VG thickens up your juice tremendously   In my case  after cutting my 18mg juice down to 6mg  I had VERY thick juice  So much so that even the most carefully wicked coil would get dry hits in my Taifun   Theres a trick to this though     The trick  Vodka   Or distilled water   Vodka  I find convenient because it comes in small bottles and unless youve been pounding it  its gonna be relatively sterile   You dont have to buy the good stuff   I have a 200mL bottle of Karkov that cost me  3 which Im using to thin my juice out  and generally put it in at a rate of about 10% on an 80VG juice  However  if youre in that 18 21 group  or if youre in recovery  and cant get or dont want to have in your house  your own vodka  Distilled Water works   Dont use tap water  especially unfiltered tap water   You dont want to be vaping microbes  chlorine and flouride  *juice dealing rebuildables drippers particular juice important high vg juice becomes much enjoyable since getting much flavor omg clouds pg becomes less important infact far less desirable since throat hit flavor heavily lified people also cut nic level least half using dripper found true using rda rta instantly dropped 18mg 6mg even 12mg unbearably harsh throat taifun cut juice shelf food grade usp glycerin cvs carries 6 small bottle skin care aisle sacrificing flavor want steep bit using shaking 1 2 times day youll also notice vg thickens juice tremendously case cutting 18mg juice 6mg thick juice much even carefully wicked coil would get dry hits taifun theres trick though trick vodka distilled water vodka find convenient comes small bottles unless youve pounding gonna relatively sterile dont buy good stuff 200ml bottle karkov cost 3 im using thin juice generally put rate 10 % 80vg juice however youre 18 21 group youre recovery cant get dont want house vodka distilled water works dont use tap water especially unfiltered tap water dont want microbes chlorine flouride
8372*    RTAs  Rebuildable tank atomizers are very similar to the clearomizers that vapers are familiar with  but  well  rebuildable   These give the user more flexibility in resistance  wicking material  coil design  etc   They also generally give better flavor and vapor production than pre builts   There are two very common classes of RTAs      Genesis   These are RTAs with the coil present on the top   This is a more classic design  but seems to be fading into obscurity as of late   Perhaps it will make a comeback like drippers did        Vacuum  bottom coil   These are the more popular ones and include models like the Kayfun  Fogger  and Taifun The coil is present at the bottom with a small wick extending out into the juice   The RTA that I use most often is the Taifun GT  a clone which I had purchased from AngelCigs  and what REALLY got me into rebuilding  *rtas rebuildable tank atomizers similar clearomizers vapers familiar well rebuildable give user flexibility resistance wicking material coil design etc also generally give better flavor vapor production pre builts two common classes rtas genesis rtas coil present top classic design seems fading obscurity late perhaps make comeback like drippers vacuum bottom coil popular ones include models like kayfun fogger taifun coil present bottom small wick extending juice rta use often taifun gt clone purchased angelcigs really got rebuilding
8374*    RDAs and Dripping   Dripping is a means of getting peak flavor and vapor production   It is  possibly  the purest way to vape   The dripper contains 1 or more coils stuffed full of a wicking material   The user will drip fluid into the RDAs and soak it up into the wicks   The majority of these will consist of several basic parts       Drip tip  The  mouthpiece        Hood   This is the top piece that attaches the drip tip to the unit itself       Base Build Deck   This is where the coils go  and usually contains 2 or more screws   The coils will either be wrappd around the screws themselves  or going through post holes below the screws       Juice well   This  well  holds the juice   This may be part of the base or may be a separate basin  such as in the Magma RDA     The dripper that I use most often currently is the Stillare  and is a clone made by Cigreen   This is  currently  August 2014  a very popular model around ECR because of its wide adjustable airflow   Well get more into that in a minute  *rdas dripping dripping means getting peak flavor vapor production possibly purest way dripper contains 1 coils stuffed full wicking material user drip fluid rdas soak wicks majority consist several basic parts drip tip mouthpiece hood top piece attaches drip tip unit base build deck coils go usually contains 2 screws coils either wrappd around screws going post holes screws juice well well holds juice may part base may separate basin magma rda dripper use often currently stillare clone made cigreen currently august 2014 popular model around ecr wide adjustable airflow well get minute

8376*    Coils  Wicks   If you open up one of the Kanger style coils  or at least  one of the older ones with the large  cup  gasket on the base of the stem  you will see that it contains a metal coil or two  stuffed full of a tiny wicking material   When you fire your vaporizer  the coil completes a circuit and heats up  vaporizing the fluid that is soaked into the attached wick   I chose this as an exle because it is common and easy to open   Another great exle is the iClear 30 coils  which you can just remove the top cap from to see the coil  and the long silica wicks protruding down to the bottom of the tank   Its important to note that finding the best coil and wick is a  personal  journey which requires a lot of experimentation  *coils wicks open one kanger style coils least one older ones large cup gasket base stem see contains metal coil two stuffed full tiny wicking material fire vaporizer coil completes circuit heats vaporizing fluid soaked attached wick chose exle common easy open another great exle iclear 30 coils remove top cap see coil long silica wicks protruding bottom tank important note finding best coil wick personal journey requires lot experimentation
8378*Beautiful  Id like to contribute a few things for the wicks section  as well    Ekowool is another wicking material thats frequently used in all types of rebuildable atomizers  Its a braided amorphous silica  rope  which is temperature stable up to 1 000 degrees Celsius  This means that it is incredibly useful for flavor sling  because it can simply be dry burned clean  In other applications  it is rather durable for the same reason  It retains liquid well  and wicks with rather good speed  It comes in a variety of diameters  but keep in mind that all diameter measurements of ekowool are the interior diameter because its a hollow material    Stainless steel mesh is another wicking  most commonly used in genesis style atomizers  Mesh comes in a variety of grades  e g  350  400  500   and these grades refer to the number of steel threads intersecting per inch  Its rather difficult to find  true  500 mesh  but it largely doesnt wick as well as 350 and 400  The general line of thought is that 350 is best for high VG juices  and 400 500 are good for mixtures  Preparing mesh wicks can be difficult  since on its own it shorts out coils  It needs to be annealed  rolled  and burned with juice on it to create an oxidized coating to prevent these shorts and hot spots    Stainless steel cable is another wicking material frequently used in genesis styles  This also needs to be torched before use to use  Make sure the cable you get is neither galvanized nor has a nylon thread in them  These things are crazy bad for you if burned  Because of the geometry of SS cable  it needs to have a sock under where the coil goes to prevent hot spots  and to evaporate liquid away evenly  Appropriate socks sleeves are ekowool and stainless mesh    Sorry if its looking pretty rough  I just woke up and this thread excited me  *beautiful id like contribute things wicks section well ekowool another wicking material thats frequently used types rebuildable atomizers braided amorphous silica rope temperature stable 1 000 degrees celsius means incredibly useful flavor sling simply dry burned clean applications rather durable reason retains liquid well wicks rather good speed comes variety diameters keep mind diameter measurements ekowool interior diameter hollow material stainless steel mesh another wicking commonly used genesis style atomizers mesh comes variety grades e g 350 400 500 grades refer number steel threads intersecting per inch rather difficult find true 500 mesh largely doesnt wick well 350 400 general line thought 350 best high vg juices 400 500 good mixtures preparing mesh wicks difficult since shorts coils needs annealed rolled burned juice create oxidized coating prevent shorts hot spots stainless steel cable another wicking material frequently used genesis styles also needs torched use use make sure cable get neither galvanized nylon thread things crazy bad burned geometry ss cable needs sock coil goes prevent hot spots evaporate liquid away evenly appropriate socks sleeves ekowool stainless mesh sorry looking pretty rough woke thread excited
8379*    Airflow  Coils and heat are only part of the picture   Airflow is another part   You need substantial airflow to have a good draw and produce a significant amount of vapor   More air will also cool down the vapor  making it easier to handle   More air will also promote a larger cloud as it is mixing in with the heated juice   Too much air  however  can be a bad thing    especially in vacuum based tanks such as the Taifun   You can mod it to increase air flow  but bear in mind that it does operate on a vacuum  and more airflow means less vacuum and prevents effective wicking   When building your coils for your RDAs  and for many RTAs  the Taifun included  you want to have your coils positioned directly in the path of the airflow   With the Taifun  the air comes in directly in the middle of the two posts   In this design  the coil should be      Centered above the air intake    Centered relative to the posts    High enough that the center of the coil is level with the wick channels     In RDAs  when you place the top cap on  you want the air intake to come directly and un obstructed into the path of the coils   This means that there should be no wick between the coil and the air intake   *airflow coils heat part picture airflow another part need substantial airflow good draw produce significant amount vapor air also cool vapor making easier handle air also promote larger cloud mixing heated juice much air however bad thing especially vacuum based tanks taifun mod increase air flow bear mind operate vacuum airflow means less vacuum prevents effective wicking building coils rdas many rtas taifun included want coils positioned directly path airflow taifun air comes directly middle two posts design coil centered air intake centered relative posts high enough center coil level wick channels rdas place top cap want air intake come directly un obstructed path coils means wick coil air intake
8380*    More on Coils   Most of the time  when you are starting out  you will be building coils with A1 Kanthal   Kanthal comes in various thicknesses called gauges   Lower gauges are thicker  where higher gauges are thinner   Most people that Ive talked to start out building coils with 28 gauge Kanthal  as its easy to work with and builds fast heating coils without having very high resistance or very small coils     Going up or down in gauge is a trade off   lower gauges  thicker  offer less resistance  but heat up  and cool down  slower   The inverse is true for higher gauges   Once you factor in total surface area  it becomes a careful balancing act to get a coil thats not too hot  not too cold  not too skinny  not too fat  not too short  not too long     Your basic coil will be several wraps of kanthal around a firm  known diameter  circular surface   Most people use drill bits or 2mm screwdrivers  however people use all sorts of stuff around these parts    q tips  toothpicks  zipties  you name it   In my Taifun  I typically stick around 1 1 2 ohms   This gives me about 8 wraps of 28 gauge Kanthal around a 5 64  bit and I find that this is ideal for me   This is called a micro coil  due to its small size   Most vacuum based RTAs do not have a lot of airflow  so its not ideal to run a very low resistance coil  as these heat up quickly   In my Stillare  I prefer a much hotter coil  and run 5 6 wraps of 26 gauge Kanthal around the same 5 64  bit   With two of these coils in parallel  I get a total resistance of 0 3 ohms  which is perfect for me  *coils time starting building coils a1 kanthal kanthal comes various thicknesses called gauges lower gauges thicker higher gauges thinner people ive talked start building coils 28 gauge kanthal easy work builds fast heating coils without high resistance small coils going gauge trade lower gauges thicker offer less resistance heat cool slower inverse true higher gauges factor total surface area becomes careful balancing act get coil thats hot cold skinny fat short long basic coil several wraps kanthal around firm known diameter circular surface people use drill bits 2mm screwdrivers however people use sorts stuff around parts q tips toothpicks zipties name taifun typically stick around 1 1 2 ohms gives 8 wraps 28 gauge kanthal around 5 64 bit find ideal called micro coil due small size vacuum based rtas lot airflow ideal run low resistance coil heat quickly stillare prefer much hotter coil run 5 6 wraps 26 gauge kanthal around 5 64 bit two coils parallel get total resistance 0 3 ohms perfect
